THE HAUNTED MAN AND THE GHOST&rsquo;S BARGAIN<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I - The Gift Bestowed<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Everybody said so.<br>
<br>
Far be it from me to assert that what everybody says must be true.&nbsp;
Everybody is, often, as likely to be wrong as right.&nbsp; In the general
experience, everybody has been wrong so often, and it has taken, in
most instances, such a weary while to find out how wrong, that the authority
is proved to be fallible.&nbsp; Everybody may sometimes be right; &ldquo;but
<i>that&rsquo;s</i> no rule,&rdquo; as the ghost of Giles Scroggins
says in the ballad.<br>
<br>
The dread word, GHOST, recalls me.<br>
<br>
Everybody said he looked like a haunted man.&nbsp; The extent of my
present claim for everybody is, that they were so far right.&nbsp; He
did.<br>
<br>
Who could have seen his hollow cheek; his sunken brilliant eye; his
black-attired figure, indefinably grim, although well-knit and well-proportioned;
his grizzled hair hanging, like tangled sea-weed, about his face, -
as if he had been, through his whole life, a lonely mark for the chafing
and beating of the great deep of humanity, - but might have said he
looked like a haunted man?<br>
<br>
Who could have observed his manner, taciturn, thoughtful, gloomy, shadowed
by habitual reserve, retiring always and jocund never, with a distraught
air of reverting to a bygone place and time, or of listening to some
old echoes in his mind, but might have said it was the manner of a haunted
man?<br>
<br>
Who could have heard his voice, slow-speaking, deep, and grave, with
a natural fulness and melody in it which he seemed to set himself against
and stop, but might have said it was the voice of a haunted man?<br>
<br>
Who that had seen him in his inner chamber, part library and part laboratory,
- for he was, as the world knew, far and wide, a learned man in chemistry,
and a teacher on whose lips and hands a crowd of aspiring ears and eyes
hung daily, - who that had seen him there, upon a winter night, alone,
surrounded by his drugs and instruments and books; the shadow of his
shaded lamp a monstrous beetle on the wall, motionless among a crowd
of spectral shapes raised there by the flickering of the fire upon the
quaint objects around him; some of these phantoms (the reflection of
glass vessels that held liquids), trembling at heart like things that
knew his power to uncombine them, and to give back their component parts
to fire and vapour; - who that had seen him then, his work done, and
he pondering in his chair before the rusted grate and red flame, moving
his thin mouth as if in speech, but silent as the dead, would not have
said that the man seemed haunted and the chamber too?<br>
<br>
Who might not, by a very easy flight of fancy, have believed that everything
about him took this haunted tone, and that he lived on haunted ground?<br>
<br>
His dwelling was so solitary and vault-like, - an old, retired part
of an ancient endowment for students, once a brave edifice, planted
in an open place, but now the obsolete whim of forgotten architects;
smoke-age-and-weather-darkened, squeezed on every side by the overgrowing
of the great city, and choked, like an old well, with stones and bricks;
its small quadrangles, lying down in very pits formed by the streets
and buildings, which, in course of time, had been constructed above
its heavy chimney stalks; its old trees, insulted by the neighbouring
smoke, which deigned to droop so low when it was very feeble and the
weather very moody; its grass-plots, struggling with the mildewed earth
to be grass, or to win any show of compromise; its silent pavements,
unaccustomed to the tread of feet, and even to the observation of eyes,
except when a stray face looked down from the upper world, wondering
what nook it was; its sun-dial in a little bricked-up corner, where
no sun had straggled for a hundred years, but where, in compensation
for the sun&rsquo;s neglect, the snow would lie for weeks when it lay
nowhere else, and the black east wind would spin like a huge humming-top,
when in all other places it was silent and still.<br>
<br>
His dwelling, at its heart and core - within doors - at his fireside
- was so lowering and old, so crazy, yet so strong, with its worn-eaten
beams of wood in the ceiling, and its sturdy floor shelving downward
to the great oak chimney-piece; so environed and hemmed in by the pressure
of the town yet so remote in fashion, age, and custom; so quiet, yet
so thundering with echoes when a distant voice was raised or a door
was shut, - echoes, not confined to the many low passages and empty
rooms, but rumbling and grumbling till they were stifled in the heavy
air of the forgotten Crypt where the Norman arches were half-buried
in the earth.<br>
<br>
You should have seen him in his dwelling about twilight, in the dead
winter time.<br>
<br>
When the wind was blowing, shrill and shrewd, with the going down of
the blurred sun.&nbsp; When it was just so dark, as that the forms of
things were indistinct and big - but not wholly lost.&nbsp; When sitters
by the fire began to see wild faces and figures, mountains and abysses,
ambuscades and armies, in the coals.&nbsp; When people in the streets
bent down their heads and ran before the weather.&nbsp; When those who
were obliged to meet it, were stopped at angry corners, stung by wandering
snow-flakes alighting on the lashes of their eyes, - which fell too
sparingly, and were blown away too quickly, to leave a trace upon the
frozen ground.&nbsp; When windows of private houses closed up tight
and warm.&nbsp; When lighted gas began to burst forth in the busy and
the quiet streets, fast blackening otherwise.&nbsp; When stray pedestrians,
shivering along the latter, looked down at the glowing fires in kitchens,
and sharpened their sharp appetites by sniffing up the fragrance of
whole miles of dinners.<br>
<br>
When travellers by land were bitter cold, and looked wearily on gloomy
landscapes, rustling and shuddering in the blast.&nbsp; When mariners
at sea, outlying upon icy yards, were tossed and swung above the howling
ocean dreadfully.&nbsp; When lighthouses, on rocks and headlands, showed
solitary and watchful; and benighted sea-birds breasted on against their
ponderous lanterns, and fell dead.&nbsp; When little readers of story-books,
by the firelight, trembled to think of Cassim Baba cut into quarters,
hanging in the Robbers&rsquo; Cave, or had some small misgivings that
the fierce little old woman, with the crutch, who used to start out
of the box in the merchant Abudah&rsquo;s bedroom, might, one of these
nights, be found upon the stairs, in the long, cold, dusky journey up
to bed.<br>
<br>
When, in rustic places, the last glimmering of daylight died away from
the ends of avenues; and the trees, arching overhead, were sullen and
black.&nbsp; When, in parks and woods, the high wet fern and sodden
moss, and beds of fallen leaves, and trunks of trees, were lost to view,
in masses of impenetrable shade.&nbsp; When mists arose from dyke, and
fen, and river.&nbsp; When lights in old halls and in cottage windows,
were a cheerful sight.&nbsp; When the mill stopped, the wheelwright
and the blacksmith shut their workshops, the turnpike-gate closed, the
plough and harrow were left lonely in the fields, the labourer and team
went home, and the striking of the church clock had a deeper sound than
at noon, and the churchyard wicket would be swung no more that night.<br>
<br>
When twilight everywhere released the shadows, prisoned up all day,
that now closed in and gathered like mustering swarms of ghosts.&nbsp;
When they stood lowering, in corners of rooms, and frowned out from
behind half-opened doors.&nbsp; When they had full possession of unoccupied
apartments.&nbsp; When they danced upon the floors, and walls, and ceilings
of inhabited chambers, while the fire was low, and withdrew like ebbing
waters when it sprang into a blaze.&nbsp; When they fantastically mocked
the shapes of household objects, making the nurse an ogress, the rocking-horse
a monster, the wondering child, half-scared and half-amused, a stranger
to itself, - the very tongs upon the hearth, a straddling giant with
his arms a-kimbo, evidently smelling the blood of Englishmen, and wanting
to grind people&rsquo;s bones to make his bread.<br>
<br>
When these shadows brought into the minds of older people, other thoughts,
and showed them different images.&nbsp; When they stole from their retreats,
in the likenesses of forms and faces from the past, from the grave,
from the deep, deep gulf, where the things that might have been, and
never were, are always wandering.<br>
<br>
When he sat, as already mentioned, gazing at the fire.&nbsp; When, as
it rose and fell, the shadows went and came.&nbsp; When he took no heed
of them, with his bodily eyes; but, let them come or let them go, looked
fixedly at the fire.&nbsp; You should have seen him, then.<br>
<br>
When the sounds that had arisen with the shadows, and come out of their
lurking-places at the twilight summons, seemed to make a deeper stillness
all about him.&nbsp; When the wind was rumbling in the chimney, and
sometimes crooning, sometimes howling, in the house.&nbsp; When the
old trees outside were so shaken and beaten, that one querulous old
rook, unable to sleep, protested now and then, in a feeble, dozy, high-up
&ldquo;Caw!&rdquo;&nbsp; When, at intervals, the window trembled, the
rusty vane upon the turret-top complained, the clock beneath it recorded
that another quarter of an hour was gone, or the fire collapsed and
fell in with a rattle.<br>
<br>
- When a knock came at his door, in short, as he was sitting so, and
roused him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Surely there had been no figure leaning on the back of his chair; no
face looking over it.&nbsp; It is certain that no gliding footstep touched
the floor, as he lifted up his head, with a start, and spoke.&nbsp;
And yet there was no mirror in the room on whose surface his own form
could have cast its shadow for a moment; and, Something had passed darkly
and gone!<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m humbly fearful, sir,&rdquo; said a fresh-coloured busy
man, holding the door open with his foot for the admission of himself
and a wooden tray he carried, and letting it go again by very gentle
and careful degrees, when he and the tray had got in, lest it should
close noisily, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s a good bit past the time to-night.&nbsp;
But Mrs. William has been taken off her legs so often&rdquo; -<br>
<br>
&ldquo;By the wind?&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; I have heard it rising.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo; - By the wind, sir - that it&rsquo;s a mercy she got home at
all.&nbsp; Oh dear, yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It was by the wind, Mr. Redlaw.&nbsp;
By the wind.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He had, by this time, put down the tray for dinner, and was employed
in lighting the lamp, and spreading a cloth on the table.&nbsp; From
this employment he desisted in a hurry, to stir and feed the fire, and
then resumed it; the lamp he had lighted, and the blaze that rose under
his hand, so quickly changing the appearance of the room, that it seemed
as if the mere coming in of his fresh red face and active manner had
made the pleasant alteration.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mrs. William is of course subject at any time, sir, to be taken
off her balance by the elements.&nbsp; She is not formed superior to
<i>that</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Mr. Redlaw good-naturedly, though abruptly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; Mrs. William may be taken off her balance by Earth;
as for example, last Sunday week, when sloppy and greasy, and she going
out to tea with her newest sister-in-law, and having a pride in herself,
and wishing to appear perfectly spotless though pedestrian.&nbsp; Mrs.
William may be taken off her balance by Air; as being once over-persuaded
by a friend to try a swing at Peckham Fair, which acted on her constitution
instantly like a steam-boat.&nbsp; Mrs. William may be taken off her
balance by Fire; as on a false alarm of engines at her mother&rsquo;s,
when she went two miles in her nightcap.&nbsp; Mrs. William may be taken
off her balance by Water; as at Battersea, when rowed into the piers
by her young nephew, Charley Swidger junior, aged twelve, which had
no idea of boats whatever.&nbsp; But these are elements.&nbsp; Mrs.
William must be taken out of elements for the strength of <i>her</i>
character to come into play.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As he stopped for a reply, the reply was &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; in the same
tone as before.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Oh dear, yes!&rdquo; said Mr. Swidger, still
proceeding with his preparations, and checking them off as he made them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it is, sir.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I always
say myself, sir.&nbsp; Such a many of us Swidgers! - Pepper.&nbsp; Why
there&rsquo;s my father, sir, superannuated keeper and custodian of
this Institution, eighty-seven year old.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a Swidger!
- Spoon.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;True, William,&rdquo; was the patient and abstracted answer,
when he stopped again.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Swidger.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I always say, sir.&nbsp; You may call him the trunk of the tree!
- Bread.&nbsp; Then you come to his successor, my unworthy self - Salt
- and Mrs. William, Swidgers both. - Knife and fork.&nbsp; Then you
come to all my brothers and their families, Swidgers, man and woman,
boy and girl.&nbsp; Why, what with cousins, uncles, aunts, and relationships
of this, that, and t&rsquo;other degree, and whatnot degree, and marriages,
and lyings-in, the Swidgers - Tumbler - might take hold of hands, and
make a ring round England!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Receiving no reply at all here, from the thoughtful man whom he addressed,
Mr. William approached, him nearer, and made a feint of accidentally
knocking the table with a decanter, to rouse him.&nbsp; The moment he
succeeded, he went on, as if in great alacrity of acquiescence.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sir!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just what I say myself, sir.&nbsp;
Mrs. William and me have often said so.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Swidgers
enough,&rsquo; we say, &lsquo;without <i>our</i> voluntary contributions,&rsquo;
- Butter.&nbsp; In fact, sir, my father is a family in himself - Castors
- to take care of; and it happens all for the best that we have no child
of our own, though it&rsquo;s made Mrs. William rather quiet-like, too.&nbsp;
Quite ready for the fowl and mashed potatoes, sir?&nbsp; Mrs. William
said she&rsquo;d dish in ten minutes when I left the Lodge.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am quite ready,&rdquo; said the other, waking as from a dream,
and walking slowly to and fro.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mrs. William has been at it again, sir!&rdquo; said the keeper,
as he stood warming a plate at the fire, and pleasantly shading his
face with it.&nbsp; Mr. Redlaw stopped in his walking, and an expression
of interest appeared in him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What I always say myself, sir.&nbsp; She <i>will</i> do it!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a motherly feeling in Mrs. William&rsquo;s breast that
must and will have went.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, sir, not satisfied with being a sort of mother to all the
young gentlemen that come up from a variety of parts, to attend your
courses of lectures at this ancient foundation - its surprising how
stone-chaney catches the heat this frosty weather, to be sure!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he turned the plate, and cooled his fingers.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Redlaw.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I say myself, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr.
William, speaking over his shoulder, as if in ready and delighted assent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly where it is, sir!&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t
one of our students but appears to regard Mrs. William in that light.&nbsp;
Every day, right through the course, they puts their heads into the
Lodge, one after another, and have all got something to tell her, or
something to ask her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Swidge&rsquo; is the appellation
by which they speak of Mrs. William in general, among themselves, I&rsquo;m
told; but that&rsquo;s what I say, sir.&nbsp; Better be called ever
so far out of your name, if it&rsquo;s done in real liking, than have
it made ever so much of, and not cared about!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a name
for?&nbsp; To know a person by.&nbsp; If Mrs. William is known by something
better than her name - I allude to Mrs. William&rsquo;s qualities and
disposition - never mind her name, though it <i>is</i> Swidger, by rights.&nbsp;
Let &rsquo;em call her Swidge, Widge, Bridge - Lord!&nbsp; London Bridge,
Blackfriars, Chelsea, Putney, Waterloo, or Hammersmith Suspension -
if they like.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The close of this triumphant oration brought him and the plate to the
table, upon which he half laid and half dropped it, with a lively sense
of its being thoroughly heated, just as the subject of his praises entered
the room, bearing another tray and a lantern, and followed by a venerable
old man with long grey hair.<br>
<br>
Mrs. William, like Mr. William, was a simple, innocent-looking person,
in whose smooth cheeks the cheerful red of her husband&rsquo;s official
waistcoat was very pleasantly repeated.&nbsp; But whereas Mr. William&rsquo;s
light hair stood on end all over his head, and seemed to draw his eyes
up with it in an excess of bustling readiness for anything, the dark
brown hair of Mrs. William was carefully smoothed down, and waved away
under a trim tidy cap, in the most exact and quiet manner imaginable.&nbsp;
Whereas Mr. William&rsquo;s very trousers hitched themselves up at the
ankles, as if it were not in their iron-grey nature to rest without
looking about them, Mrs. William&rsquo;s neatly-flowered skirts - red
and white, like her own pretty face - were as composed and orderly,
as if the very wind that blew so hard out of doors could not disturb
one of their folds.&nbsp; Whereas his coat had something of a fly-away
and half-off appearance about the collar and breast, her little bodice
was so placid and neat, that there should have been protection for her,
in it, had she needed any, with the roughest people.&nbsp; Who could
have had the heart to make so calm a bosom swell with grief, or throb
with fear, or flutter with a thought of shame!&nbsp; To whom would its
repose and peace have not appealed against disturbance, like the innocent
slumber of a child!<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Punctual, of course, Milly,&rdquo; said her husband, relieving
her of the tray, &ldquo;or it wouldn&rsquo;t be you.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
Mrs. William, sir! - He looks lonelier than ever to-night,&rdquo; whispering
to his wife, as he was taking the tray, &ldquo;and ghostlier altogether.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Without any show of hurry or noise, or any show of herself even, she
was so calm and quiet, Milly set the dishes she had brought upon the
table, - Mr. William, after much clattering and running about, having
only gained possession of a butter-boat of gravy, which he stood ready
to serve.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is that the old man has in his arms?&rdquo; asked Mr. Redlaw,
as he sat down to his solitary meal.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Holly, sir,&rdquo; replied the quiet voice of Milly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say myself, sir,&rdquo; interposed Mr. William,
striking in with the butter-boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Berries is so seasonable
to the time of year! - Brown gravy!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Another Christmas come, another year gone!&rdquo; murmured the
Chemist, with a gloomy sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;More figures in the lengthening
sum of recollection that we work and work at to our torment, till Death
idly jumbles all together, and rubs all out.&nbsp; So, Philip!&rdquo;
breaking off, and raising his voice as he addressed the old man, standing
apart, with his glistening burden in his arms, from which the quiet
Mrs. William took small branches, which she noiselessly trimmed with
her scissors, and decorated the room with, while her aged father-in-law
looked on much interested in the ceremony.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My duty to you, sir,&rdquo; returned the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should
have spoke before, sir, but know your ways, Mr. Redlaw - proud to say
- and wait till spoke to!&nbsp; Merry Christmas, sir, and Happy New
Year, and many of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Have had a pretty many of &rsquo;em
myself - ha, ha! - and may take the liberty of wishing &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m eighty-seven!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Have you had so many that were merry and happy?&rdquo; asked
the other.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, sir, ever so many,&rdquo; returned the old man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is his memory impaired with age?&nbsp; It is to be expected now,&rdquo;
said Mr. Redlaw, turning to the son, and speaking lower.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not a morsel of it, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. William.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
exactly what I say myself, sir.&nbsp; There never was such a memory
as my father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the most wonderful man in the
world.&nbsp; He don&rsquo;t know what forgetting means.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the very observation I&rsquo;m always making to Mrs. William, sir, if
you&rsquo;ll believe me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Swidger, in his polite desire to seem to acquiesce at all events,
delivered this as if there were no iota of contradiction in it, and
it were all said in unbounded and unqualified assent.<br>
<br>
The Chemist pushed his plate away, and, rising from the table, walked
across the room to where the old man stood looking at a little sprig
of holly in his hand.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It recalls the time when many of those years were old and new,
then?&rdquo; he said, observing him attentively, and touching him on
the shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh many, many!&rdquo; said Philip, half awaking from his reverie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m eighty-seven!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Merry and happy, was it?&rdquo; asked the Chemist in a low voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Merry and happy, old man?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Maybe as high as that, no higher,&rdquo; said the old man, holding
out his hand a little way above the level of his knee, and looking retrospectively
at his questioner, &ldquo;when I first remember &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Cold,
sunshiny day it was, out a-walking, when some one - it was my mother
as sure as you stand there, though I don&rsquo;t know what her blessed
face was like, for she took ill and died that Christmas-time - told
me they were food for birds.&nbsp; The pretty little fellow thought
- that&rsquo;s me, you understand - that birds&rsquo; eyes were so bright,
perhaps, because the berries that they lived on in the winter were so
bright.&nbsp; I recollect that.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m eighty-seven!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Merry and happy!&rdquo; mused the other, bending his dark eyes
upon the stooping figure, with a smile of compassion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Merry
and happy - and remember well?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, ay!&rdquo; resumed the old man, catching the last words.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I remember &rsquo;em well in my school time, year after year,
and all the merry-making that used to come along with them.&nbsp; I
was a strong chap then, Mr. Redlaw; and, if you&rsquo;ll believe me,
hadn&rsquo;t my match at football within ten mile.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
my son William?&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t my match at football, William, within
ten mile!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I always say, father!&rdquo; returned the son
promptly, and with great respect.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ARE a Swidger, if
ever there was one of the family!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; said the old man, shaking his head as he again looked
at the holly.&nbsp; &ldquo;His mother - my son William&rsquo;s my youngest
son - and I, have sat among &rsquo;em all, boys and girls, little children
and babies, many a year, when the berries like these were not shining
half so bright all round us, as their bright faces.&nbsp; Many of &rsquo;em
are gone; she&rsquo;s gone; and my son George (our eldest, who was her
pride more than all the rest!) is fallen very low: but I can see them,
when I look here, alive and healthy, as they used to be in those days;
and I can see him, thank God, in his innocence.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a blessed
thing to me, at eighty-seven.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The keen look that had been fixed upon him with so much earnestness,
had gradually sought the ground.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When my circumstances got to be not so good as formerly, through
not being honestly dealt by, and I first come here to be custodian,&rdquo;
said the old man, &ldquo; - which was upwards of fifty years ago - where&rsquo;s
my son William?&nbsp; More than half a century ago, William!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say, father,&rdquo; replied the son, as promptly
and dutifully as before, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s exactly where it is.&nbsp;
Two times ought&rsquo;s an ought, and twice five ten, and there&rsquo;s
a hundred of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It was quite a pleasure to know that one of our founders - or
more correctly speaking,&rdquo; said the old man, with a great glory
in his subject and his knowledge of it, &ldquo;one of the learned gentlemen
that helped endow us in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, for we were founded
afore her day - left in his will, among the other bequests he made us,
so much to buy holly, for garnishing the walls and windows, come Christmas.&nbsp;
There was something homely and friendly in it.&nbsp; Being but strange
here, then, and coming at Christmas time, we took a liking for his very
picter that hangs in what used to be, anciently, afore our ten poor
gentlemen commuted for an annual stipend in money, our great Dinner
Hall. - A sedate gentleman in a peaked beard, with a ruff round his
neck, and a scroll below him, in old English letters, &lsquo;Lord! keep
my memory green!&rsquo;&nbsp; You know all about him, Mr. Redlaw?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I know the portrait hangs there, Philip.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, sure, it&rsquo;s the second on the right, above the panelling.&nbsp;
I was going to say - he has helped to keep <i>my</i> memory green, I
thank him; for going round the building every year, as I&rsquo;m a doing
now, and freshening up the bare rooms with these branches and berries,
freshens up my bare old brain.&nbsp; One year brings back another, and
that year another, and those others numbers!&nbsp; At last, it seems
to me as if the birth-time of our Lord was the birth-time of all I have
ever had affection for, or mourned for, or delighted in, - and they&rsquo;re
a pretty many, for I&rsquo;m eighty-seven!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Merry and happy,&rdquo; murmured Redlaw to himself.<br>
<br>
The room began to darken strangely.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So you see, sir,&rdquo; pursued old Philip, whose hale wintry
cheek had warmed into a ruddier glow, and whose blue eyes had brightened
while he spoke, &ldquo;I have plenty to keep, when I keep this present
season.&nbsp; Now, where&rsquo;s my quiet Mouse?&nbsp; Chattering&rsquo;s
the sin of my time of life, and there&rsquo;s half the building to do
yet, if the cold don&rsquo;t freeze us first, or the wind don&rsquo;t
blow us away, or the darkness don&rsquo;t swallow us up.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The quiet Mouse had brought her calm face to his side, and silently
taken his arm, before he finished speaking.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come away, my dear,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Redlaw won&rsquo;t settle to his dinner, otherwise, till it&rsquo;s
cold as the winter.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me rambling on,
sir, and I wish you good night, and, once again, a merry - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said Mr. Redlaw, resuming his place at the table,
more, it would have seemed from his manner, to reassure the old keeper,
than in any remembrance of his own appetite.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spare me another
moment, Philip.&nbsp; William, you were going to tell me something to
your excellent wife&rsquo;s honour.&nbsp; It will not be disagreeable
to her to hear you praise her.&nbsp; What was it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s where it is, you see, sir,&rdquo; returned
Mr. William Swidger, looking towards his wife in considerable embarrassment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mrs. William&rsquo;s got her eye upon me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not afraid of Mrs. William&rsquo;s eye?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, no, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. Swidger, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
what I say myself.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t made to be afraid of.&nbsp;
It wouldn&rsquo;t have been made so mild, if that was the intention.&nbsp;
But I wouldn&rsquo;t like to - Milly! - him, you know.&nbsp; Down in
the Buildings.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. William, standing behind the table, and rummaging disconcertedly
among the objects upon it, directed persuasive glances at Mrs. William,
and secret jerks of his head and thumb at Mr. Redlaw, as alluring her
towards him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Him, you know, my love,&rdquo; said Mr. William.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down
in the Buildings.&nbsp; Tell, my dear!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the works
of Shakespeare in comparison with myself.&nbsp; Down in the Buildings,
you know, my love. - Student.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Student?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Redlaw, raising his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say, sir!&rdquo; cried Mr. William, in the
utmost animation of assent.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t the poor
student down in the Buildings, why should you wish to hear it from Mrs.
William&rsquo;s lips?&nbsp; Mrs. William, my dear - Buildings.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Milly, with a quiet frankness,
free from any haste or confusion, &ldquo;that William had said anything
about it, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have come.&nbsp; I asked him not to.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a sick young gentleman, sir - and very poor, I am afraid
- who is too ill to go home this holiday-time, and lives, unknown to
any one, in but a common kind of lodging for a gentleman, down in Jerusalem
Buildings.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why have I never heard of him?&rdquo; said the Chemist, rising
hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why has he not made his situation known to me?&nbsp;
Sick! - give me my hat and cloak.&nbsp; Poor! - what house? - what number?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t go there, sir,&rdquo; said Milly, leaving
her father-in-law, and calmly confronting him with her collected little
face and folded hands.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not go there?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; said Milly, shaking her head as at a most
manifest and self-evident impossibility.&nbsp; &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t
be thought of!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; Why not?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, you see, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. William Swidger, persuasively
and confidentially, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I say.&nbsp; Depend upon
it, the young gentleman would never have made his situation known to
one of his own sex.&nbsp; Mrs. Williams has got into his confidence,
but that&rsquo;s quite different.&nbsp; They all confide in Mrs. William;
they all trust <i>her</i>.&nbsp; A man, sir, couldn&rsquo;t have got
a whisper out of him; but woman, sir, and Mrs. William combined - !&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is good sense and delicacy in what you say, William,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Redlaw, observant of the gentle and composed face at his
shoulder.&nbsp; And laying his finger on his lip, he secretly put his
purse into her hand.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear no, sir!&rdquo; cried Milly, giving it back again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Worse and worse!&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t be dreamed of!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Such a staid matter-of-fact housewife she was, and so unruffled by the
momentary haste of this rejection, that, an instant afterwards, she
was tidily picking up a few leaves which had strayed from between her
scissors and her apron, when she had arranged the holly.<br>
<br>
Finding, when she rose from her stooping posture, that Mr. Redlaw was
still regarding her with doubt and astonishment, she quietly repeated
- looking about, the while, for any other fragments that might have
escaped her observation:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear no, sir!&nbsp; He said that of all the world he would
not be known to you, or receive help from you - though he is a student
in your class.&nbsp; I have made no terms of secrecy with you, but I
trust to your honour completely.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why did he say so?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Indeed I can&rsquo;t tell, sir,&rdquo; said Milly, after thinking
a little, &ldquo;because I am not at all clever, you know; and I wanted
to be useful to him in making things neat and comfortable about him,
and employed myself that way.&nbsp; But I know he is poor, and lonely,
and I think he is somehow neglected too. - How dark it is!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The room had darkened more and more.&nbsp; There was a very heavy gloom
and shadow gathering behind the Chemist&rsquo;s chair.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What more about him?&rdquo; he asked.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He is engaged to be married when he can afford it,&rdquo; said
Milly, &ldquo;and is studying, I think, to qualify himself to earn a
living.&nbsp; I have seen, a long time, that he has studied hard and
denied himself much. - How very dark it is!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s turned colder, too,&rdquo; said the old man, rubbing
his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chill and dismal feeling in
the room.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my son William?&nbsp; William, my boy,
turn the lamp, and rouse the fire!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Milly&rsquo;s voice resumed, like quiet music very softly played:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He muttered in his broken sleep yesterday afternoon, after talking
to me&rdquo; (this was to herself) &ldquo;about some one dead, and some
great wrong done that could never be forgotten; but whether to him or
to another person, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Not <i>by</i> him, I am
sure.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And, in short, Mrs. William, you see - which she wouldn&rsquo;t
say herself, Mr. Redlaw, if she was to stop here till the new year after
this next one - &rdquo; said Mr. William, coming up to him to speak
in his ear, &ldquo;has done him worlds of good!&nbsp; Bless you, worlds
of good!&nbsp; All at home just the same as ever - my father made as
snug and comfortable - not a crumb of litter to be found in the house,
if you were to offer fifty pound ready money for it - Mrs. William apparently
never out of the way - yet Mrs. William backwards and forwards, backwards
and forwards, up and down, up and down, a mother to him!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The room turned darker and colder, and the gloom and shadow gathering
behind the chair was heavier.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not content with this, sir, Mrs. William goes and finds, this
very night, when she was coming home (why it&rsquo;s not above a couple
of hours ago), a creature more like a young wild beast than a young
child, shivering upon a door-step.&nbsp; What does Mrs. William do,
but brings it home to dry it, and feed it, and keep it till our old
Bounty of food and flannel is given away, on Christmas morning!&nbsp;
If it ever felt a fire before, it&rsquo;s as much as ever it did; for
it&rsquo;s sitting in the old Lodge chimney, staring at ours as if its
ravenous eyes would never shut again.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s sitting there,
at least,&rdquo; said Mr. William, correcting himself, on reflection,
&ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s bolted!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Heaven keep her happy!&rdquo; said the Chemist aloud, &ldquo;and
you too, Philip! and you, William!&nbsp; I must consider what to do
in this.&nbsp; I may desire to see this student, I&rsquo;ll not detain
you any longer now.&nbsp; Good-night!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I thank&rsquo;ee, sir, I thank&rsquo;ee!&rdquo; said the old
man, &ldquo;for Mouse, and for my son William, and for myself.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my son William?&nbsp; William, you take the lantern and
go on first, through them long dark passages, as you did last year and
the year afore.&nbsp; Ha ha!&nbsp; <i>I</i> remember - though I&rsquo;m
eighty-seven!&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord, keep my memory green!&rsquo;&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a very good prayer, Mr. Redlaw, that of the learned gentleman
in the peaked beard, with a ruff round his neck - hangs up, second on
the right above the panelling, in what used to be, afore our ten poor
gentlemen commuted, our great Dinner Hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord, keep my
memory green!&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very good and pious, sir.&nbsp;
Amen!&nbsp; Amen!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As they passed out and shut the heavy door, which, however carefully
withheld, fired a long train of thundering reverberations when it shut
at last, the room turned darker.<br>
<br>
As he fell a musing in his chair alone, the healthy holly withered on
the wall, and dropped - dead branches.<br>
<br>
As the gloom and shadow thickened behind him, in that place where it
had been gathering so darkly, it took, by slow degrees, - or out of
it there came, by some unreal, unsubstantial process - not to be traced
by any human sense, - an awful likeness of himself!<br>
<br>
Ghastly and cold, colourless in its leaden face and hands, but with
his features, and his bright eyes, and his grizzled hair, and dressed
in the gloomy shadow of his dress, it came into his terrible appearance
of existence, motionless, without a sound.&nbsp; As <i>he</i> leaned
his arm upon the elbow of his chair, ruminating before the fire, <i>it</i>
leaned upon the chair-back, close above him, with its appalling copy
of his face looking where his face looked, and bearing the expression
his face bore.<br>
<br>
This, then, was the Something that had passed and gone already.&nbsp;
This was the dread companion of the haunted man!<br>
<br>
It took, for some moments, no more apparent heed of him, than he of
it.&nbsp; The Christmas Waits were playing somewhere in the distance,
and, through his thoughtfulness, he seemed to listen to the music.&nbsp;
It seemed to listen too.<br>
<br>
At length he spoke; without moving or lifting up his face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here again!&rdquo; he said.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here again,&rdquo; replied the Phantom.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I see you in the fire,&rdquo; said the haunted man; &ldquo;I
hear you in music, in the wind, in the dead stillness of the night.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Phantom moved its head, assenting.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why do you come, to haunt me thus?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I come as I am called,&rdquo; replied the Ghost.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Unbidden,&rdquo; exclaimed the Chemist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Unbidden be it,&rdquo; said the Spectre.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is enough.&nbsp;
I am here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Hitherto the light of the fire had shone on the two faces - if the dread
lineaments behind the chair might be called a face - both addressed
towards it, as at first, and neither looking at the other.&nbsp; But,
now, the haunted man turned, suddenly, and stared upon the Ghost.&nbsp;
The Ghost, as sudden in its motion, passed to before the chair, and
stared on him.<br>
<br>
The living man, and the animated image of himself dead, might so have
looked, the one upon the other.&nbsp; An awful survey, in a lonely and
remote part of an empty old pile of building, on a winter night, with
the loud wind going by upon its journey of mystery - whence or whither,
no man knowing since the world began - and the stars, in unimaginable
millions, glittering through it, from eternal space, where the world&rsquo;s
bulk is as a grain, and its hoary age is infancy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look upon me!&rdquo; said the Spectre.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am he,
neglected in my youth, and miserably poor, who strove and suffered,
and still strove and suffered, until I hewed out knowledge from the
mine where it was buried, and made rugged steps thereof, for my worn
feet to rest and rise on.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I <i>am</i> that man,&rdquo; returned the Chemist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No mother&rsquo;s self-denying love,&rdquo; pursued the Phantom,
&ldquo;no father&rsquo;s counsel, aided <i>me</i>.&nbsp; A stranger
came into my father&rsquo;s place when I was but a child, and I was
easily an alien from my mother&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; My parents, at the
best, were of that sort whose care soon ends, and whose duty is soon
done; who cast their offspring loose, early, as birds do theirs; and,
if they do well, claim the merit; and, if ill, the pity.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It paused, and seemed to tempt and goad him with its look, and with
the manner of its speech, and with its smile.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; pursued the Phantom, &ldquo;who, in this struggle
upward, found a friend.&nbsp; I made him - won him - bound him to me!&nbsp;
We worked together, side by side.&nbsp; All the love and confidence
that in my earlier youth had had no outlet, and found no expression,
I bestowed on him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; said Redlaw, hoarsely.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, not all,&rdquo; returned the Phantom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
a sister.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The haunted man, with his head resting on his hands, replied &ldquo;I
had!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Phantom, with an evil smile, drew closer to the
chair, and resting its chin upon its folded hands, its folded hands
upon the back, and looking down into his face with searching eyes, that
seemed instinct with fire, went on:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Such glimpses of the light of home as I had ever known, had streamed
from her.&nbsp; How young she was, how fair, how loving!&nbsp; I took
her to the first poor roof that I was master of, and made it rich.&nbsp;
She came into the darkness of my life, and made it bright. - She is
before me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I saw her, in the fire, but now.&nbsp; I hear her in music, in
the wind, in the dead stillness of the night,&rdquo; returned the haunted
man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>Did</i> he love her?&rdquo; said the Phantom, echoing his
contemplative tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think he did, once.&nbsp; I am sure
he did.&nbsp; Better had she loved him less - less secretly, less dearly,
from the shallower depths of a more divided heart!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Let me forget it!&rdquo; said the Chemist, with an angry motion
of his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me blot it from my memory!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Spectre, without stirring, and with its unwinking, cruel eyes still
fixed upon his face, went on:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A dream, like hers, stole upon my own life.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; said Redlaw.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A love, as like hers,&rdquo; pursued the Phantom, &ldquo;as my
inferior nature might cherish, arose in my own heart.&nbsp; I was too
poor to bind its object to my fortune then, by any thread of promise
or entreaty.&nbsp; I loved her far too well, to seek to do it.&nbsp;
But, more than ever I had striven in my life, I strove to climb!&nbsp;
Only an inch gained, brought me something nearer to the height.&nbsp;
I toiled up!&nbsp; In the late pauses of my labour at that time, - my
sister (sweet companion!) still sharing with me the expiring embers
and the cooling hearth, - when day was breaking, what pictures of the
future did I see!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I saw them, in the fire, but now,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
come back to me in music, in the wind, in the dead stillness of the
night, in the revolving years.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo; - Pictures of my own domestic life, in aftertime, with her who
was the inspiration of my toil.&nbsp; Pictures of my sister, made the
wife of my dear friend, on equal terms - for he had some inheritance,
we none - pictures of our sobered age and mellowed happiness, and of
the golden links, extending back so far, that should bind us, and our
children, in a radiant garland,&rdquo; said the Phantom.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Pictures,&rdquo; said the haunted man, &ldquo;that were delusions.&nbsp;
Why is it my doom to remember them too well!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Delusions,&rdquo; echoed the Phantom in its changeless voice,
and glaring on him with its changeless eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my friend
(in whose breast my confidence was locked as in my own), passing between
me and the centre of the system of my hopes and struggles, won her to
himself, and shattered my frail universe.&nbsp; My sister, doubly dear,
doubly devoted, doubly cheerful in my home, lived on to see me famous,
and my old ambition so rewarded when its spring was broken, and then
- &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then died,&rdquo; he interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Died, gentle as
ever; happy; and with no concern but for her brother.&nbsp; Peace!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Phantom watched him silently.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Remembered!&rdquo; said the haunted man, after a pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; So well remembered, that even now, when years have
passed, and nothing is more idle or more visionary to me than the boyish
love so long outlived, I think of it with sympathy, as if it were a
younger brother&rsquo;s or a son&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Sometimes I even wonder
when her heart first inclined to him, and how it had been affected towards
me. - Not lightly, once, I think. - But that is nothing.&nbsp; Early
unhappiness, a wound from a hand I loved and trusted, and a loss that
nothing can replace, outlive such fancies.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said the Phantom, &ldquo;I bear within me a Sorrow
and a Wrong.&nbsp; Thus I prey upon myself.&nbsp; Thus, memory is my
curse; and, if I could forget my sorrow and my wrong, I would!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mocker!&rdquo; said the Chemist, leaping up, and making, with
a wrathful hand, at the throat of his other self.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why have
I always that taunt in my ears?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Forbear!&rdquo; exclaimed the Spectre in an awful voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lay a hand on Me, and die!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He stopped midway, as if its words had paralysed him, and stood looking
on it.&nbsp; It had glided from him; it had its arm raised high in warning;
and a smile passed over its unearthly features, as it reared its dark
figure in triumph.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If I could forget my sorrow and wrong, I would,&rdquo; the Ghost
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I could forget my sorrow and my wrong, I would!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Evil spirit of myself,&rdquo; returned the haunted man, in a
low, trembling tone, &ldquo;my life is darkened by that incessant whisper.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is an echo,&rdquo; said the Phantom.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If it be an echo of my thoughts - as now, indeed, I know it is,&rdquo;
rejoined the haunted man, &ldquo;why should I, therefore, be tormented?&nbsp;
It is not a selfish thought.&nbsp; I suffer it to range beyond myself.&nbsp;
All men and women have their sorrows, - most of them their wrongs; ingratitude,
and sordid jealousy, and interest, besetting all degrees of life.&nbsp;
Who would not forget their sorrows and their wrongs?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who would not, truly, and be happier and better for it?&rdquo;
said the Phantom.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;These revolutions of years, which we commemorate,&rdquo; proceeded
Redlaw, &ldquo;what do <i>they</i> recall!&nbsp; Are there any minds
in which they do not re-awaken some sorrow, or some trouble?&nbsp; What
is the remembrance of the old man who was here to-night?&nbsp; A tissue
of sorrow and trouble.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But common natures,&rdquo; said the Phantom, with its evil smile
upon its glassy face, &ldquo;unenlightened minds and ordinary spirits,
do not feel or reason on these things like men of higher cultivation
and profounder thought.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tempter,&rdquo; answered Redlaw, &ldquo;whose hollow look and
voice I dread more than words can express, and from whom some dim foreshadowing
of greater fear is stealing over me while I speak, I hear again an echo
of my own mind.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Receive it as a proof that I am powerful,&rdquo; returned the
Ghost.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear what I offer!&nbsp; Forget the sorrow, wrong,
and trouble you have known!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Forget them!&rdquo; he repeated.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have the power to cancel their remembrance - to leave but very
faint, confused traces of them, that will die out soon,&rdquo; returned
the Spectre.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say!&nbsp; Is it done?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; cried the haunted man, arresting by a terrified
gesture the uplifted hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tremble with distrust and
doubt of you; and the dim fear you cast upon me deepens into a nameless
horror I can hardly bear. - I would not deprive myself of any kindly
recollection, or any sympathy that is good for me, or others.&nbsp;
What shall I lose, if I assent to this?&nbsp; What else will pass from
my remembrance?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No knowledge; no result of study; nothing but the intertwisted
chain of feelings and associations, each in its turn dependent on, and
nourished by, the banished recollections.&nbsp; Those will go.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are they so many?&rdquo; said the haunted man, reflecting in
alarm.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They have been wont to show themselves in the fire, in music,
in the wind, in the dead stillness of the night, in the revolving years,&rdquo;
returned the Phantom scornfully.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In nothing else?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Phantom held its peace.<br>
<br>
But having stood before him, silent, for a little while, it moved towards
the fire; then stopped.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Decide!&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;before the opportunity is lost!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A moment!&nbsp; I call Heaven to witness,&rdquo; said the agitated
man, &ldquo;that I have never been a hater of any kind, - never morose,
indifferent, or hard, to anything around me.&nbsp; If, living here alone,
I have made too much of all that was and might have been, and too little
of what is, the evil, I believe, has fallen on me, and not on others.&nbsp;
But, if there were poison in my body, should I not, possessed of antidotes
and knowledge how to use them, use them?&nbsp; If there be poison in
my mind, and through this fearful shadow I can cast it out, shall I
not cast it out?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the Spectre, &ldquo;is it done?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A moment longer!&rdquo; he answered hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I
would forget it if I could</i>!&nbsp; Have <i>I</i> thought that, alone,
or has it been the thought of thousands upon thousands, generation after
generation?&nbsp; All human memory is fraught with sorrow and trouble.&nbsp;
My memory is as the memory of other men, but other men have not this
choice.&nbsp; Yes, I close the bargain.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I WILL forget
my sorrow, wrong, and trouble!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the Spectre, &ldquo;is it done?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;IT IS.&nbsp; And take this with you, man whom I here renounce!&nbsp;
The gift that I have given, you shall give again, go where you will.&nbsp;
Without recovering yourself the power that you have yielded up, you
shall henceforth destroy its like in all whom you approach.&nbsp; Your
wisdom has discovered that the memory of sorrow, wrong, and trouble
is the lot of all mankind, and that mankind would be the happier, in
its other memories, without it.&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; Be its benefactor!&nbsp;
Freed from such remembrance, from this hour, carry involuntarily the
blessing of such freedom with you.&nbsp; Its diffusion is inseparable
and inalienable from you.&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; Be happy in the good you have
won, and in the good you do!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Phantom, which had held its bloodless hand above him while it spoke,
as if in some unholy invocation, or some ban; and which had gradually
advanced its eyes so close to his, that he could see how they did not
participate in the terrible smile upon its face, but were a fixed, unalterable,
steady horror melted before him and was gone.<br>
<br>
As he stood rooted to the spot, possessed by fear and wonder, and imagining
he heard repeated in melancholy echoes, dying away fainter and fainter,
the words, &ldquo;Destroy its like in all whom you approach!&rdquo;
a shrill cry reached his ears.&nbsp; It came, not from the passages
beyond the door, but from another part of the old building, and sounded
like the cry of some one in the dark who had lost the way.<br>
<br>
He looked confusedly upon his hands and limbs, as if to be assured of
his identity, and then shouted in reply, loudly and wildly; for there
was a strangeness and terror upon him, as if he too were lost.<br>
<br>
The cry responding, and being nearer, he caught up the lamp, and raised
a heavy curtain in the wall, by which he was accustomed to pass into
and out of the theatre where he lectured, - which adjoined his room.&nbsp;
Associated with youth and animation, and a high amphitheatre of faces
which his entrance charmed to interest in a moment, it was a ghostly
place when all this life was faded out of it, and stared upon him like
an emblem of Death.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloa!&nbsp; This way!&nbsp;
Come to the light!&rdquo;&nbsp; When, as he held the curtain with one
hand, and with the other raised the lamp and tried to pierce the gloom
that filled the place, something rushed past him into the room like
a wild-cat, and crouched down in a corner.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, hastily.<br>
<br>
He might have asked &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; even had he seen it well,
as presently he did when he stood looking at it gathered up in its corner.<br>
<br>
A bundle of tatters, held together by a hand, in size and form almost
an infant&rsquo;s, but in its greedy, desperate little clutch, a bad
old man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A face rounded and smoothed by some half-dozen
years, but pinched and twisted by the experiences of a life.&nbsp; Bright
eyes, but not youthful.&nbsp; Naked feet, beautiful in their childish
delicacy, - ugly in the blood and dirt that cracked upon them.&nbsp;
A baby savage, a young monster, a child who had never been a child,
a creature who might live to take the outward form of man, but who,
within, would live and perish a mere beast.<br>
<br>
Used, already, to be worried and hunted like a beast, the boy crouched
down as he was looked at, and looked back again, and interposed his
arm to ward off the expected blow.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bite,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you hit me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The time had been, and not many minutes since, when such a sight as
this would have wrung the Chemist&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; He looked upon
it now, coldly; but with a heavy effort to remember something - he did
not know what - he asked the boy what he did there, and whence he came.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the woman?&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want
to find the woman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The woman.&nbsp; Her that brought me here, and set me by the
large fire.&nbsp; She was so long gone, that I went to look for her,
and lost myself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you.&nbsp; I want the woman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He made a spring, so suddenly, to get away, that the dull sound of his
naked feet upon the floor was near the curtain, when Redlaw caught him
by his rags.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come! you let me go!&rdquo; muttered the boy, struggling, and
clenching his teeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing to you.&nbsp;
Let me go, will you, to the woman!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That is not the way.&nbsp; There is a nearer one,&rdquo; said
Redlaw, detaining him, in the same blank effort to remember some association
that ought, of right, to bear upon this monstrous object.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is your name?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Got none.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where do you live?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Live!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The boy shook his hair from his eyes to look at him for a moment, and
then, twisting round his legs and wrestling with him, broke again into
his repetition of &ldquo;You let me go, will you?&nbsp; I want to find
the woman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist led him to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said,
looking at him still confusedly, but with repugnance and avoidance,
growing out of his coldness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The sharp eyes in the child&rsquo;s head, wandering round the room,
lighted on the table where the remnants of the dinner were.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Give me some of that!&rdquo; he said, covetously.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Has she not fed you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I shall be hungry again to-morrow, sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I?&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t I hungry every day?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Finding himself released, he bounded at the table like some small animal
of prey, and hugging to his breast bread and meat, and his own rags,
all together, said:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There!&nbsp; Now take me to the woman!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As the Chemist, with a new-born dislike to touch him, sternly motioned
him to follow, and was going out of the door, he trembled and stopped.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The gift that I have given, you shall give again, go where you
will!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Phantom&rsquo;s words were blowing in the wind, and the wind blew
chill upon him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go there, to-night,&rdquo; he murmured faintly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go nowhere to-night.&nbsp; Boy! straight down this
long-arched passage, and past the great dark door into the yard, - you
see the fire shining on the window there.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s fire?&rdquo; inquired the boy.<br>
<br>
He nodded, and the naked feet had sprung away.&nbsp; He came back with
his lamp, locked his door hastily, and sat down in his chair, covering
his face like one who was frightened at himself.<br>
<br>
For now he was, indeed, alone.&nbsp; Alone, alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II - The Gift Diffused<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A small man sat in a small parlour, partitioned off from a small shop
by a small screen, pasted all over with small scraps of newspapers.&nbsp;
In company with the small man, was almost any amount of small children
you may please to name - at least it seemed so; they made, in that very
limited sphere of action, such an imposing effect, in point of numbers.<br>
<br>
Of these small fry, two had, by some strong machinery, been got into
bed in a corner, where they might have reposed snugly enough in the
sleep of innocence, but for a constitutional propensity to keep awake,
and also to scuffle in and out of bed.&nbsp; The immediate occasion
of these predatory dashes at the waking world, was the construction
of an oyster-shell wall in a corner, by two other youths of tender age;
on which fortification the two in bed made harassing descents (like
those accursed Picts and Scots who beleaguer the early historical studies
of most young Britons), and then withdrew to their own territory.<br>
<br>
In addition to the stir attendant on these inroads, and the retorts
of the invaded, who pursued hotly, and made lunges at the bed-clothes
under which the marauders took refuge, another little boy, in another
little bed, contributed his mite of confusion to the family stock, by
casting his boots upon the waters; in other words, by launching these
and several small objects, inoffensive in themselves, though of a hard
substance considered as missiles, at the disturbers of his repose, -
who were not slow to return these compliments.<br>
<br>
Besides which, another little boy - the biggest there, but still little
- was tottering to and fro, bent on one side, and considerably affected
in his knees by the weight of a large baby, which he was supposed by
a fiction that obtains sometimes in sanguine families, to be hushing
to sleep.&nbsp; But oh! the inexhaustible regions of contemplation and
watchfulness into which this baby&rsquo;s eyes were then only beginning
to compose themselves to stare, over his unconscious shoulder!<br>
<br>
It was a very Moloch of a baby, on whose insatiate altar the whole existence
of this particular young brother was offered up a daily sacrifice.&nbsp;
Its personality may be said to have consisted in its never being quiet,
in any one place, for five consecutive minutes, and never going to sleep
when required.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tetterby&rsquo;s baby&rdquo; was as well
known in the neighbourhood as the postman or the pot-boy.&nbsp; It roved
from door-step to door-step, in the arms of little Johnny Tetterby,
and lagged heavily at the rear of troops of juveniles who followed the
Tumblers or the Monkey, and came up, all on one side, a little too late
for everything that was attractive, from Monday morning until Saturday
night.&nbsp; Wherever childhood congregated to play, there was little
Moloch making Johnny fag and toil.&nbsp; Wherever Johnny desired to
stay, little Moloch became fractious, and would not remain.&nbsp; Whenever
Johnny wanted to go out, Moloch was asleep, and must be watched.&nbsp;
Whenever Johnny wanted to stay at home, Moloch was awake, and must be
taken out.&nbsp; Yet Johnny was verily persuaded that it was a faultless
baby, without its peer in the realm of England, and was quite content
to catch meek glimpses of things in general from behind its skirts,
or over its limp flapping bonnet, and to go staggering about with it
like a very little porter with a very large parcel, which was not directed
to anybody, and could never be delivered anywhere.<br>
<br>
The small man who sat in the small parlour, making fruitless attempts
to read his newspaper peaceably in the midst of this disturbance, was
the father of the family, and the chief of the firm described in the
inscription over the little shop front, by the name and title of A.
TETTERBY AND CO., NEWSMEN.&nbsp; Indeed, strictly speaking, he was the
only personage answering to that designation, as Co. was a mere poetical
abstraction, altogether baseless and impersonal.<br>
<br>
Tetterby&rsquo;s was the corner shop in Jerusalem Buildings.&nbsp; There
was a good show of literature in the window, chiefly consisting of picture-newspapers
out of date, and serial pirates, and footpads.&nbsp; Walking-sticks,
likewise, and marbles, were included in the stock in trade.&nbsp; It
had once extended into the light confectionery line; but it would seem
that those elegancies of life were not in demand about Jerusalem Buildings,
for nothing connected with that branch of commerce remained in the window,
except a sort of small glass lantern containing a languishing mass of
bull&rsquo;s-eyes, which had melted in the summer and congealed in the
winter until all hope of ever getting them out, or of eating them without
eating the lantern too, was gone for ever.&nbsp; Tetterby&rsquo;s had
tried its hand at several things.&nbsp; It had once made a feeble little
dart at the toy business; for, in another lantern, there was a heap
of minute wax dolls, all sticking together upside down, in the direst
confusion, with their feet on one another&rsquo;s heads, and a precipitate
of broken arms and legs at the bottom.&nbsp; It had made a move in the
millinery direction, which a few dry, wiry bonnet-shapes remained in
a corner of the window to attest.&nbsp; It had fancied that a living
might lie hidden in the tobacco trade, and had stuck up a representation
of a native of each of the three integral portions of the British Empire,
in the act of consuming that fragrant weed; with a poetic legend attached,
importing that united in one cause they sat and joked, one chewed tobacco,
one took snuff, one smoked: but nothing seemed to have come of it -
except flies.&nbsp; Time had been when it had put a forlorn trust in
imitative jewellery, for in one pane of glass there was a card of cheap
seals, and another of pencil-cases, and a mysterious black amulet of
inscrutable intention, labelled ninepence.&nbsp; But, to that hour,
Jerusalem Buildings had bought none of them.&nbsp; In short, Tetterby&rsquo;s
had tried so hard to get a livelihood out of Jerusalem Buildings in
one way or other, and appeared to have done so indifferently in all,
that the best position in the firm was too evidently Co.&rsquo;s; Co.,
as a bodiless creation, being untroubled with the vulgar inconveniences
of hunger and thirst, being chargeable neither to the poor&rsquo;s-rates
nor the assessed taxes, and having no young family to provide for.<br>
<br>
Tetterby himself, however, in his little parlour, as already mentioned,
having the presence of a young family impressed upon his mind in a manner
too clamorous to be disregarded, or to comport with the quiet perusal
of a newspaper, laid down his paper, wheeled, in his distraction, a
few times round the parlour, like an undecided carrier-pigeon, made
an ineffectual rush at one or two flying little figures in bed-gowns
that skimmed past him, and then, bearing suddenly down upon the only
unoffending member of the family, boxed the ears of little Moloch&rsquo;s
nurse.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You bad boy!&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you
any feeling for your poor father after the fatigues and anxieties of
a hard winter&rsquo;s day, since five o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
but must you wither his rest, and corrode his latest intelligence, with
<i>your</i> wicious tricks?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it enough, sir, that your
brother &rsquo;Dolphus is toiling and moiling in the fog and cold, and
you rolling in the lap of luxury with a - with a baby, and everything
you can wish for,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, heaping this up as a great
climax of blessings, &ldquo;but must you make a wilderness of home,
and maniacs of your parents?&nbsp; Must you, Johnny?&nbsp; Hey?&rdquo;&nbsp;
At each interrogation, Mr. Tetterby made a feint of boxing his ears
again, but thought better of it, and held his hand.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; whimpered Johnny, &ldquo;when I wasn&rsquo;t
doing anything, I&rsquo;m sure, but taking such care of Sally, and getting
her to sleep.&nbsp; Oh, father!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wish my little woman would come home!&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby,
relenting and repenting, &ldquo;I only wish my little woman would come
home!&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t fit to deal with &rsquo;em.&nbsp; They make
my head go round, and get the better of me.&nbsp; Oh, Johnny!&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t it enough that your dear mother has provided you with that
sweet sister?&rdquo; indicating Moloch; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it enough
that you were seven boys before without a ray of gal, and that your
dear mother went through what she <i>did</i> go through, on purpose
that you might all of you have a little sister, but must you so behave
yourself as to make my head swim?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Softening more and more, as his own tender feelings and those of his
injured son were worked on, Mr. Tetterby concluded by embracing him,
and immediately breaking away to catch one of the real delinquents.&nbsp;
A reasonably good start occurring, he succeeded, after a short but smart
run, and some rather severe cross-country work under and over the bedsteads,
and in and out among the intricacies of the chairs, in capturing this
infant, whom he condignly punished, and bore to bed.&nbsp; This example
had a powerful, and apparently, mesmeric influence on him of the boots,
who instantly fell into a deep sleep, though he had been, but a moment
before, broad awake, and in the highest possible feather.&nbsp; Nor
was it lost upon the two young architects, who retired to bed, in an
adjoining closet, with great privacy and speed.&nbsp; The comrade of
the Intercepted One also shrinking into his nest with similar discretion,
Mr. Tetterby, when he paused for breath, found himself unexpectedly
in a scene of peace.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My little woman herself,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, wiping his
flushed face, &ldquo;could hardly have done it better!&nbsp; I only
wish my little woman had had it to do, I do indeed!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby sought upon his screen for a passage appropriate to be
impressed upon his children&rsquo;s minds on the occasion, and read
the following.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It is an undoubted fact that all remarkable men have had
remarkable mothers, and have respected them in after life as their best
friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; Think of your own remarkable mother, my boys,&rdquo;
said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;and know her value while she is still among
you!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He sat down again in his chair by the fire, and composed himself, cross-legged,
over his newspaper.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Let anybody, I don&rsquo;t care who it is, get out of bed again,&rdquo;
said Tetterby, as a general proclamation, delivered in a very soft-hearted
manner, &ldquo;and astonishment will be the portion of that respected
contemporary!&rdquo; - which expression Mr. Tetterby selected from his
screen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Johnny, my child, take care of your only sister,
Sally; for she&rsquo;s the brightest gem that ever sparkled on your
early brow.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Johnny sat down on a little stool, and devotedly crushed himself beneath
the weight of Moloch.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, what a gift that baby is to you, Johnny!&rdquo; said his
father, &ldquo;and how thankful you ought to be!&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
not generally known, Johnny,&rsquo;&rdquo; he was now referring to the
screen again, &ldquo;&lsquo;but it is a fact ascertained, by accurate
calculations, that the following immense percentage of babies never
attain to two years old; that is to say - &rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, father, please!&rdquo; cried Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t bear it, when I think of Sally.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby desisting, Johnny, with a profound sense of his trust,
wiped his eyes, and hushed his sister.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your brother &rsquo;Dolphus,&rdquo; said his father, poking the
fire, &ldquo;is late to-night, Johnny, and will come home like a lump
of ice.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s got your precious mother?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s mother, and &rsquo;Dolphus too, father!&rdquo; exclaimed
Johnny, &ldquo;I think.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; returned his father, listening.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the footstep of my little woman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The process of induction, by which Mr Tetterby had come to the conclusion
that his wife was a little woman, was his own secret.&nbsp; She would
have made two editions of himself, very easily.&nbsp; Considered as
an individual, she was rather remarkable for being robust and portly;
but considered with reference to her husband, her dimensions became
magnificent.&nbsp; Nor did they assume a less imposing proportion, when
studied with reference to the size of her seven sons, who were but diminutive.&nbsp;
In the case of Sally, however, Mrs. Tetterby had asserted herself, at
last; as nobody knew better than the victim Johnny, who weighed and
measured that exacting idol every hour in the day.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby, who had been marketing, and carried a basket, threw back
her bonnet and shawl, and sitting down, fatigued, commanded Johnny to
bring his sweet charge to her straightway, for a kiss.&nbsp; Johnny
having complied, and gone back to his stool, and again crushed himself,
Master Adolphus Tetterby, who had by this time unwound his torso out
of a prismatic comforter, apparently interminable, requested the same
favour.&nbsp; Johnny having again complied, and again gone back to his
stool, and again crushed himself, Mr. Tetterby, struck by a sudden thought,
preferred the same claim on his own parental part.&nbsp; The satisfaction
of this third desire completely exhausted the sacrifice, who had hardly
breath enough left to get back to his stool, crush himself again, and
pant at his relations.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Whatever you do, Johnny,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, shaking her
head, &ldquo;take care of her, or never look your mother in the face
again.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nor your brother,&rdquo; said Adolphus.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nor your father, Johnny,&rdquo; added Mr. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
Johnny, much affected by this conditional renunciation of him, looked
down at Moloch&rsquo;s eyes to see that they were all right, so far,
and skilfully patted her back (which was uppermost), and rocked her
with his foot.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are you wet, &rsquo;Dolphus, my boy?&rdquo; said his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come and take my chair, and dry yourself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, father, thank&rsquo;ee,&rdquo; said Adolphus, smoothing himself
down with his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I an&rsquo;t very wet, I don&rsquo;t
think.&nbsp; Does my face shine much, father?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, it <i>does</i> look waxy, my boy,&rdquo; returned Mr. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the weather, father,&rdquo; said Adolphus, polishing
his cheeks on the worn sleeve of his jacket.&nbsp; &ldquo;What with
rain, and sleet, and wind, and snow, and fog, my face gets quite brought
out into a rash sometimes.&nbsp; And shines, it does - oh, don&rsquo;t
it, though!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Adolphus was also in the newspaper line of life, being employed,
by a more thriving firm than his father and Co., to vend newspapers
at a railway station, where his chubby little person, like a shabbily-disguised
Cupid, and his shrill little voice (he was not much more than ten years
old), were as well known as the hoarse panting of the locomotives, running
in and out.&nbsp; His juvenility might have been at some loss for a
harmless outlet, in this early application to traffic, but for a fortunate
discovery he made of a means of entertaining himself, and of dividing
the long day into stages of interest, without neglecting business.&nbsp;
This ingenious invention, remarkable, like many great discoveries, for
its simplicity, consisted in varying the first vowel in the word &ldquo;paper,&rdquo;
and substituting, in its stead, at different periods of the day, all
the other vowels in grammatical succession.&nbsp; Thus, before daylight
in the winter-time, he went to and fro, in his little oilskin cap and
cape, and his big comforter, piercing the heavy air with his cry of
&ldquo;Morn-ing Pa-per!&rdquo; which, about an hour before noon, changed
to &ldquo;Morn-ing Pepper!&rdquo; which, at about two, changed to &ldquo;Morn-ing
Pip-per!&rdquo; which in a couple of hours changed to &ldquo;Morn-ing
Pop-per!&rdquo; and so declined with the sun into &ldquo;Eve-ning Pup-per!&rdquo;
to the great relief and comfort of this young gentleman&rsquo;s spirits.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby, his lady-mother, who had been sitting with her bonnet
and shawl thrown back, as aforesaid, thoughtfully turning her wedding-ring
round and round upon her finger, now rose, and divesting herself of
her out-of-door attire, began to lay the cloth for supper.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, dear me, dear me, dear me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the world goes!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Which is the way the world goes, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mr. Tetterby,
looking round.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby elevated his eyebrows, folded his newspaper afresh, and
carried his eyes up it, and down it, and across it, but was wandering
in his attention, and not reading it.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby, at the same time, laid the cloth, but rather as if she
were punishing the table than preparing the family supper; hitting it
unnecessarily hard with the knives and forks, slapping it with the plates,
dinting it with the salt-cellar, and coming heavily down upon it with
the loaf.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, dear me, dear me, dear me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the world goes!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My duck,&rdquo; returned her husband, looking round again, &ldquo;you
said that before.&nbsp; Which is the way the world goes?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sophia!&rdquo; remonstrated her husband, &ldquo;you said <i>that</i>
before, too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll say it again if you like,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh nothing - there!&nbsp; And again if you like,
oh nothing - there!&nbsp; And again if you like, oh nothing - now then!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby brought his eye to bear upon the partner of his bosom,
and said, in mild astonishment:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My little woman, what has put you out?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&nbsp; Who said I was put out at all?&nbsp;
<i>I</i> never did.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby gave up the perusal of his newspaper as a bad job, and,
taking a slow walk across the room, with his hands behind him, and his
shoulders raised - his gait according perfectly with the resignation
of his manner - addressed himself to his two eldest offspring.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your supper will be ready in a minute, &rsquo;Dolphus,&rdquo;
said Mr. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother has been out in the wet,
to the cook&rsquo;s shop, to buy it.&nbsp; It was very good of your
mother so to do.&nbsp; <i>You</i> shall get some supper too, very soon,
Johnny.&nbsp; Your mother&rsquo;s pleased with you, my man, for being
so attentive to your precious sister.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby, without any remark, but with a decided subsidence of
her animosity towards the table, finished her preparations, and took,
from her ample basket, a substantial slab of hot pease pudding wrapped
in paper, and a basin covered with a saucer, which, on being uncovered,
sent forth an odour so agreeable, that the three pair of eyes in the
two beds opened wide and fixed themselves upon the banquet.&nbsp; Mr.
Tetterby, without regarding this tacit invitation to be seated, stood
repeating slowly, &ldquo;Yes, yes, your supper will be ready in a minute,
&rsquo;Dolphus - your mother went out in the wet, to the cook&rsquo;s
shop, to buy it.&nbsp; It was very good of your mother so to do&rdquo;
- until Mrs. Tetterby, who had been exhibiting sundry tokens of contrition
behind him, caught him round the neck, and wept.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, Dolphus!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, &ldquo;how could I go
and behave so?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This reconciliation affected Adolphus the younger and Johnny to that
degree, that they both, as with one accord, raised a dismal cry, which
had the effect of immediately shutting up the round eyes in the beds,
and utterly routing the two remaining little Tetterbys, just then stealing
in from the adjoining closet to see what was going on in the eating
way.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am sure, &rsquo;Dolphus,&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Tetterby, &ldquo;coming
home, I had no more idea than a child unborn - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby seemed to dislike this figure of speech, and observed,
&ldquo;Say than the baby, my dear.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo; - Had no more idea than the baby,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.
- &ldquo;Johnny, don&rsquo;t look at me, but look at her, or she&rsquo;ll
fall out of your lap and be killed, and then you&rsquo;ll die in agonies
of a broken heart, and serve you right. - No more idea I hadn&rsquo;t
than that darling, of being cross when I came home; but somehow, &rsquo;Dolphus
- &rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Tetterby paused, and again turned her wedding-ring
round and round upon her finger.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;I understand!&nbsp;
My little woman was put out.&nbsp; Hard times, and hard weather, and
hard work, make it trying now and then.&nbsp; I see, bless your soul!&nbsp;
No wonder!&nbsp; Dolf, my man,&rdquo; continued Mr. Tetterby, exploring
the basin with a fork, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your mother been and bought,
at the cook&rsquo;s shop, besides pease pudding, a whole knuckle of
a lovely roast leg of pork, with lots of crackling left upon it, and
with seasoning gravy and mustard quite unlimited.&nbsp; Hand in your
plate, my boy, and begin while it&rsquo;s simmering.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Master Adolphus, needing no second summons, received his portion with
eyes rendered moist by appetite, and withdrawing to his particular stool,
fell upon his supper tooth and nail.&nbsp; Johnny was not forgotten,
but received his rations on bread, lest he should, in a flush of gravy,
trickle any on the baby.&nbsp; He was required, for similar reasons,
to keep his pudding, when not on active service, in his pocket.<br>
<br>
There might have been more pork on the knucklebone, - which knucklebone
the carver at the cook&rsquo;s shop had assuredly not forgotten in carving
for previous customers - but there was no stint of seasoning, and that
is an accessory dreamily suggesting pork, and pleasantly cheating the
sense of taste.&nbsp; The pease pudding, too, the gravy and mustard,
like the Eastern rose in respect of the nightingale, if they were not
absolutely pork, had lived near it; so, upon the whole, there was the
flavour of a middle-sized pig.&nbsp; It was irresistible to the Tetterbys
in bed, who, though professing to slumber peacefully, crawled out when
unseen by their parents, and silently appealed to their brothers for
any gastronomic token of fraternal affection.&nbsp; They, not hard of
heart, presenting scraps in return, it resulted that a party of light
skirmishers in nightgowns were careering about the parlour all through
supper, which harassed Mr. Tetterby exceedingly, and once or twice imposed
upon him the necessity of a charge, before which these guerilla troops
retired in all directions and in great confusion.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby did not enjoy her supper.&nbsp; There seemed to be something
on Mrs. Tetterby&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; At one time she laughed without
reason, and at another time she cried without reason, and at last she
laughed and cried together in a manner so very unreasonable that her
husband was confounded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My little woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;if the world
goes that way, it appears to go the wrong way, and to choke you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Give me a drop of water,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, struggling
with herself, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t speak to me for the present, or
take any notice of me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby having administered the water, turned suddenly on the unlucky
Johnny (who was full of sympathy), and demanded why he was wallowing
there, in gluttony and idleness, instead of coming forward with the
baby, that the sight of her might revive his mother.&nbsp; Johnny immediately
approached, borne down by its weight; but Mrs. Tetterby holding out
her hand to signify that she was not in a condition to bear that trying
appeal to her feelings, he was interdicted from advancing another inch,
on pain of perpetual hatred from all his dearest connections; and accordingly
retired to his stool again, and crushed himself as before.<br>
<br>
After a pause, Mrs. Tetterby said she was better now, and began to laugh.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My little woman,&rdquo; said her husband, dubiously, &ldquo;are
you quite sure you&rsquo;re better?&nbsp; Or are you, Sophia, about
to break out in a fresh direction?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, &rsquo;Dolphus, no,&rdquo; replied his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
quite myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, settling her hair, and pressing
the palms of her hands upon her eyes, she laughed again.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What a wicked fool I was, to think so for a moment!&rdquo; said
Mrs. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come nearer, &rsquo;Dolphus, and let me
ease my mind, and tell you what I mean.&nbsp; Let me tell you all about
it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby bringing his chair closer, Mrs. Tetterby laughed again,
gave him a hug, and wiped her eyes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You know, Dolphus, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, &ldquo;that
when I was single, I might have given myself away in several directions.&nbsp;
At one time, four after me at once; two of them were sons of Mars.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all sons of Ma&rsquo;s, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr.
Tetterby, &ldquo;jointly with Pa&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; replied his wife, &ldquo;I mean
soldiers - serjeants.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;Dolphus, I&rsquo;m sure I never think of such things
now, to regret them; and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve got as good a husband,
and would do as much to prove that I was fond of him, as - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As any little woman in the world,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; <i>Very</i> good.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
If Mr. Tetterby had been ten feet high, he could not have expressed
a gentler consideration for Mrs. Tetterby&rsquo;s fairy-like stature;
and if Mrs. Tetterby had been two feet high, she could not have felt
it more appropriately her due.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But you see, &rsquo;Dolphus,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, &ldquo;this
being Christmas-time, when all people who can, make holiday, and when
all people who have got money, like to spend some, I did, somehow, get
a little out of sorts when I was in the streets just now.&nbsp; There
were so many things to be sold - such delicious things to eat, such
fine things to look at, such delightful things to have - and there was
so much calculating and calculating necessary, before I durst lay out
a sixpence for the commonest thing; and the basket was so large, and
wanted so much in it; and my stock of money was so small, and would
go such a little way; - you hate me, don&rsquo;t you, &rsquo;Dolphus?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;as yet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole truth,&rdquo; pursued
his wife, penitently, &ldquo;and then perhaps you will.&nbsp; I felt
all this, so much, when I was trudging about in the cold, and when I
saw a lot of other calculating faces and large baskets trudging about,
too, that I began to think whether I mightn&rsquo;t have done better,
and been happier, if - I - hadn&rsquo;t - &rdquo; the wedding-ring went
round again, and Mrs. Tetterby shook her downcast head as she turned
it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said her husband quietly; &ldquo;if you hadn&rsquo;t
married at all, or if you had married somebody else?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really
what I thought.&nbsp; Do you hate me now, &rsquo;Dolphus?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why no,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
find that I do, as yet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby gave him a thankful kiss, and went on.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I begin to hope you won&rsquo;t, now, &rsquo;Dolphus, though
I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t told you the worst.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
think what came over me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I was ill,
or mad, or what I was, but I couldn&rsquo;t call up anything that seemed
to bind us to each other, or to reconcile me to my fortune.&nbsp; All
the pleasures and enjoyments we had ever had - <i>they</i> seemed so
poor and insignificant, I hated them.&nbsp; I could have trodden on
them.&nbsp; And I could think of nothing else, except our being poor,
and the number of mouths there were at home.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, shaking her hand
encouragingly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s truth, after all.&nbsp; We <i>are</i>
poor, and there <i>are</i> a number of mouths at home here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah! but, Dolf, Dolf!&rdquo; cried his wife, laying her hands
upon his neck, &ldquo;my good, kind, patient fellow, when I had been
at home a very little while - how different!&nbsp; Oh, Dolf, dear, how
different it was!&nbsp; I felt as if there was a rush of recollection
on me, all at once, that softened my hard heart, and filled it up till
it was bursting.&nbsp; All our struggles for a livelihood, all our cares
and wants since we have been married, all the times of sickness, all
the hours of watching, we have ever had, by one another, or by the children,
seemed to speak to me, and say that they had made us one, and that I
never might have been, or could have been, or would have been, any other
than the wife and mother I am.&nbsp; Then, the cheap enjoyments that
I could have trodden on so cruelly, got to be so precious to me - Oh
so priceless, and dear! - that I couldn&rsquo;t bear to think how much
I had wronged them; and I said, and say again a hundred times, how could
I ever behave so, &rsquo;Dolphus, how could I ever have the heart to
do it!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The good woman, quite carried away by her honest tenderness and remorse,
was weeping with all her heart, when she started up with a scream, and
ran behind her husband.&nbsp; Her cry was so terrified, that the children
started from their sleep and from their beds, and clung about her.&nbsp;
Nor did her gaze belie her voice, as she pointed to a pale man in a
black cloak who had come into the room.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Look at that man!&nbsp; Look there!&nbsp; What does he want?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; returned her husband, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him
if you&rsquo;ll let me go.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter!&nbsp; How
you shake!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I saw him in the street, when I was out just now.&nbsp; He looked
at me, and stood near me.&nbsp; I am afraid of him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Afraid of him!&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why - I - stop! husband!&rdquo; for he was
going towards the stranger.<br>
<br>
She had one hand pressed upon her forehead, and one upon her breast;
and there was a peculiar fluttering all over her, and a hurried unsteady
motion of her eyes, as if she had lost something.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are you ill, my dear?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is it that is going from me again?&rdquo; she muttered,
in a low voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;What <i>is</i> this that is going away?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then she abruptly answered:&nbsp; &ldquo;Ill?&nbsp; No, I am quite well,&rdquo;
and stood looking vacantly at the floor.<br>
<br>
Her husband, who had not been altogether free from the infection of
her fear at first, and whom the present strangeness of her manner did
not tend to reassure, addressed himself to the pale visitor in the black
cloak, who stood still, and whose eyes were bent upon the ground.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What may be your pleasure, sir,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;with
us?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I fear that my coming in unperceived,&rdquo; returned the visitor,
&ldquo;has alarmed you; but you were talking and did not hear me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My little woman says - perhaps you heard her say it,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s not the first time you have alarmed
her to-night.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am sorry for it.&nbsp; I remember to have observed her, for
a few moments only, in the street.&nbsp; I had no intention of frightening
her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As he raised his eyes in speaking, she raised hers.&nbsp; It was extraordinary
to see what dread she had of him, and with what dread he observed it
- and yet how narrowly and closely.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is Redlaw.&nbsp; I come from
the old college hard by.&nbsp; A young gentleman who is a student there,
lodges in your house, does he not?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Denham?&rdquo; said Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was a natural action, and so slight as to be hardly noticeable; but
the little man, before speaking again, passed his hand across his forehead,
and looked quickly round the room, as though he were sensible of some
change in its atmosphere.&nbsp; The Chemist, instantly transferring
to him the look of dread he had directed towards the wife, stepped back,
and his face turned paler.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The gentleman&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said Tetterby, &ldquo;is upstairs,
sir.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a more convenient private entrance; but as
you have come in here, it will save your going out into the cold, if
you&rsquo;ll take this little staircase,&rdquo; showing one communicating
directly with the parlour, &ldquo;and go up to him that way, if you
wish to see him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, I wish to see him,&rdquo; said the Chemist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can
you spare a light?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The watchfulness of his haggard look, and the inexplicable distrust
that darkened it, seemed to trouble Mr. Tetterby.&nbsp; He paused; and
looking fixedly at him in return, stood for a minute or so, like a man
stupefied, or fascinated.<br>
<br>
At length he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll light you, sir, if you&rsquo;ll
follow me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Chemist, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to
be attended, or announced to him.&nbsp; He does not expect me.&nbsp;
I would rather go alone.&nbsp; Please to give me the light, if you can
spare it, and I&rsquo;ll find the way.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the quickness of his expression of this desire, and in taking the
candle from the newsman, he touched him on the breast.&nbsp; Withdrawing
his hand hastily, almost as though he had wounded him by accident (for
he did not know in what part of himself his new power resided, or how
it was communicated, or how the manner of its reception varied in different
persons), he turned and ascended the stair.<br>
<br>
But when he reached the top, he stopped and looked down.&nbsp; The wife
was standing in the same place, twisting her ring round and round upon
her finger.&nbsp; The husband, with his head bent forward on his breast,
was musing heavily and sullenly.&nbsp; The children, still clustering
about the mother, gazed timidly after the visitor, and nestled together
when they saw him looking down.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said the father, roughly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
enough of this.&nbsp; Get to bed here!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The place is inconvenient and small enough,&rdquo; the mother
added, &ldquo;without you.&nbsp; Get to bed!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The whole brood, scared and sad, crept away; little Johnny and the baby
lagging last.&nbsp; The mother, glancing contemptuously round the sordid
room, and tossing from her the fragments of their meal, stopped on the
threshold of her task of clearing the table, and sat down, pondering
idly and dejectedly.&nbsp; The father betook himself to the chimney-corner,
and impatiently raking the small fire together, bent over it as if he
would monopolise it all.&nbsp; They did not interchange a word.<br>
<br>
The Chemist, paler than before, stole upward like a thief; looking back
upon the change below, and dreading equally to go on or return.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What have I done!&rdquo; he said, confusedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
am I going to do!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To be the benefactor of mankind,&rdquo; he thought he heard a
voice reply.<br>
<br>
He looked round, but there was nothing there; and a passage now shutting
out the little parlour from his view, he went on, directing his eyes
before him at the way he went.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is only since last night,&rdquo; he muttered gloomily, &ldquo;that
I have remained shut up, and yet all things are strange to me.&nbsp;
I am strange to myself.&nbsp; I am here, as in a dream.&nbsp; What interest
have I in this place, or in any place that I can bring to my remembrance?&nbsp;
My mind is going blind!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
There was a door before him, and he knocked at it.&nbsp; Being invited,
by a voice within, to enter, he complied.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is that my kind nurse?&rdquo; said the voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I need not ask her.&nbsp; There is no one else to come here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It spoke cheerfully, though in a languid tone, and attracted his attention
to a young man lying on a couch, drawn before the chimney-piece, with
the back towards the door.&nbsp; A meagre scanty stove, pinched and
hollowed like a sick man&rsquo;s cheeks, and bricked into the centre
of a hearth that it could scarcely warm, contained the fire, to which
his face was turned.&nbsp; Being so near the windy house-top, it wasted
quickly, and with a busy sound, and the burning ashes dropped down fast.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They chink when they shoot out here,&rdquo; said the student,
smiling, &ldquo;so, according to the gossips, they are not coffins,
but purses.&nbsp; I shall be well and rich yet, some day, if it please
God, and shall live perhaps to love a daughter Milly, in remembrance
of the kindest nature and the gentlest heart in the world.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He put up his hand as if expecting her to take it, but, being weakened,
he lay still, with his face resting on his other hand, and did not turn
round.<br>
<br>
The Chemist glanced about the room; - at the student&rsquo;s books and
papers, piled upon a table in a corner, where they, and his extinguished
reading-lamp, now prohibited and put away, told of the attentive hours
that had gone before this illness, and perhaps caused it; - at such
signs of his old health and freedom, as the out-of-door attire that
hung idle on the wall; - at those remembrances of other and less solitary
scenes, the little miniatures upon the chimney-piece, and the drawing
of home; - at that token of his emulation, perhaps, in some sort, of
his personal attachment too, the framed engraving of himself, the looker-on.&nbsp;
The time had been, only yesterday, when not one of these objects, in
its remotest association of interest with the living figure before him,
would have been lost on Redlaw.&nbsp; Now, they were but objects; or,
if any gleam of such connexion shot upon him, it perplexed, and not
enlightened him, as he stood looking round with a dull wonder.<br>
<br>
The student, recalling the thin hand which had remained so long untouched,
raised himself on the couch, and turned his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Redlaw!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and started up.<br>
<br>
Redlaw put out his arm.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come nearer to me.&nbsp; I will sit here.&nbsp; Remain
you, where you are!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He sat down on a chair near the door, and having glanced at the young
man standing leaning with his hand upon the couch, spoke with his eyes
averted towards the ground.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I heard, by an accident, by what accident is no matter, that
one of my class was ill and solitary.&nbsp; I received no other description
of him, than that he lived in this street.&nbsp; Beginning my inquiries
at the first house in it, I have found him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have been ill, sir,&rdquo; returned the student, not merely
with a modest hesitation, but with a kind of awe of him, &ldquo;but
am greatly better.&nbsp; An attack of fever - of the brain, I believe
- has weakened me, but I am much better.&nbsp; I cannot say I have been
solitary, in my illness, or I should forget the ministering hand that
has been near me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You are speaking of the keeper&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Redlaw.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The student bent his head, as if he rendered
her some silent homage.<br>
<br>
The Chemist, in whom there was a cold, monotonous apathy, which rendered
him more like a marble image on the tomb of the man who had started
from his dinner yesterday at the first mention of this student&rsquo;s
case, than the breathing man himself, glanced again at the student leaning
with his hand upon the couch, and looked upon the ground, and in the
air, as if for light for his blinded mind.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I remembered your name,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when it was mentioned
to me down stairs, just now; and I recollect your face.&nbsp; We have
held but very little personal communication together?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Very little.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You have retired and withdrawn from me, more than any of the
rest, I think?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The student signified assent.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; said the Chemist; not with the least expression
of interest, but with a moody, wayward kind of curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why?&nbsp;
How comes it that you have sought to keep especially from me, the knowledge
of your remaining here, at this season, when all the rest have dispersed,
and of your being ill?&nbsp; I want to know why this is?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The young man, who had heard him with increasing agitation, raised his
downcast eyes to his face, and clasping his hands together, cried with
sudden earnestness and with trembling lips:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Redlaw!&nbsp; You have discovered me.&nbsp; You know my secret!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Secret?&rdquo; said the Chemist, harshly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; Your manner, so different from the interest and sympathy
which endear you to so many hearts, your altered voice, the constraint
there is in everything you say, and in your looks,&rdquo; replied the
student, &ldquo;warn me that you know me.&nbsp; That you would conceal
it, even now, is but a proof to me (God knows I need none!) of your
natural kindness and of the bar there is between us.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A vacant and contemptuous laugh, was all his answer.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But, Mr. Redlaw,&rdquo; said the student, &ldquo;as a just man,
and a good man, think how innocent I am, except in name and descent,
of participation in any wrong inflicted on you or in any sorrow you
have borne.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sorrow!&rdquo; said Redlaw, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wrong!&nbsp;
What are those to me?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; entreated the shrinking student,
&ldquo;do not let the mere interchange of a few words with me change
you like this, sir!&nbsp; Let me pass again from your knowledge and
notice.&nbsp; Let me occupy my old reserved and distant place among
those whom you instruct.&nbsp; Know me only by the name I have assumed,
and not by that of Longford - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Longford!&rdquo; exclaimed the other.<br>
<br>
He clasped his head with both his hands, and for a moment turned upon
the young man his own intelligent and thoughtful face.&nbsp; But the
light passed from it, like the sun-beam of an instant, and it clouded
as before.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The name my mother bears, sir,&rdquo; faltered the young man,
&ldquo;the name she took, when she might, perhaps, have taken one more
honoured.&nbsp; Mr. Redlaw,&rdquo; hesitating, &ldquo;I believe I know
that history.&nbsp; Where my information halts, my guesses at what is
wanting may supply something not remote from the truth.&nbsp; I am the
child of a marriage that has not proved itself a well-assorted or a
happy one.&nbsp; From infancy, I have heard you spoken of with honour
and respect - with something that was almost reverence.&nbsp; I have
heard of such devotion, of such fortitude and tenderness, of such rising
up against the obstacles which press men down, that my fancy, since
I learnt my little lesson from my mother, has shed a lustre on your
name.&nbsp; At last, a poor student myself, from whom could I learn
but you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw, unmoved, unchanged, and looking at him with a staring frown,
answered by no word or sign.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; pursued the other, &ldquo;I should try in
vain to say, how much it has impressed me, and affected me, to find
the gracious traces of the past, in that certain power of winning gratitude
and confidence which is associated among us students (among the humblest
of us, most) with Mr. Redlaw&rsquo;s generous name.&nbsp; Our ages and
positions are so different, sir, and I am so accustomed to regard you
from a distance, that I wonder at my own presumption when I touch, however
lightly, on that theme.&nbsp; But to one who - I may say, who felt no
common interest in my mother once - it may be something to hear, now
that all is past, with what indescribable feelings of affection I have,
in my obscurity, regarded him; with what pain and reluctance I have
kept aloof from his encouragement, when a word of it would have made
me rich; yet how I have felt it fit that I should hold my course, content
to know him, and to be unknown.&nbsp; Mr. Redlaw,&rdquo; said the student,
faintly, &ldquo;what I would have said, I have said ill, for my strength
is strange to me as yet; but for anything unworthy in this fraud of
mine, forgive me, and for all the rest forget me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The staring frown remained on Redlaw&rsquo;s face, and yielded to no
other expression until the student, with these words, advanced towards
him, as if to touch his hand, when he drew back and cried to him:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come nearer to me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The young man stopped, shocked by the eagerness of his recoil, and by
the sternness of his repulsion; and he passed his hand, thoughtfully,
across his forehead.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The past is past,&rdquo; said the Chemist.&nbsp; &ldquo;It dies
like the brutes.&nbsp; Who talks to me of its traces in my life?&nbsp;
He raves or lies!&nbsp; What have I to do with your distempered dreams?&nbsp;
If you want money, here it is.&nbsp; I came to offer it; and that is
all I came for.&nbsp; There can be nothing else that brings me here,&rdquo;
he muttered, holding his head again, with both his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
<i>can</i> be nothing else, and yet - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
He had tossed his purse upon the table.&nbsp; As he fell into this dim
cogitation with himself, the student took it up, and held it out to
him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Take it back, sir,&rdquo; he said proudly, though not angrily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish you could take from me, with it, the remembrance of your
words and offer.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; he retorted, with a wild light in his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist went close to him, for the first time, and took the purse,
and turned him by the arm, and looked him in the face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is sorrow and trouble in sickness, is there not?&rdquo;
he demanded, with a laugh.<br>
<br>
The wondering student answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In its unrest, in its anxiety, in its suspense, in all its train
of physical and mental miseries?&rdquo; said the Chemist, with a wild
unearthly exultation.&nbsp; &ldquo;All best forgotten, are they not?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The student did not answer, but again passed his hand, confusedly, across
his forehead.&nbsp; Redlaw still held him by the sleeve, when Milly&rsquo;s
voice was heard outside.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can see very well now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thank you, Dolf.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t cry, dear.&nbsp; Father and mother will be comfortable again,
to-morrow, and home will be comfortable too.&nbsp; A gentleman with
him, is there!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw released his hold, as he listened.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have feared, from the first moment,&rdquo; he murmured to himself,
&ldquo;to meet her.&nbsp; There is a steady quality of goodness in her,
that I dread to influence.&nbsp; I may be the murderer of what is tenderest
and best within her bosom.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She was knocking at the door.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Shall I dismiss it as an idle foreboding, or still avoid her?&rdquo;
he muttered, looking uneasily around.<br>
<br>
She was knocking at the door again.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Of all the visitors who could come here,&rdquo; he said, in a
hoarse alarmed voice, turning to his companion, &ldquo;this is the one
I should desire most to avoid.&nbsp; Hide me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The student opened a frail door in the wall, communicating where the
garret-roof began to slope towards the floor, with a small inner room.&nbsp;
Redlaw passed in hastily, and shut it after him.<br>
<br>
The student then resumed his place upon the couch, and called to her
to enter.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dear Mr. Edmund,&rdquo; said Milly, looking round, &ldquo;they
told me there was a gentleman here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is no one here but I.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There has been some one?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, there has been some one.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She put her little basket on the table, and went up to the back of the
couch, as if to take the extended hand - but it was not there.&nbsp;
A little surprised, in her quiet way, she leaned over to look at his
face, and gently touched him on the brow.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are you quite as well to-night?&nbsp; Your head is not so cool
as in the afternoon.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; said the student, petulantly, &ldquo;very little
ails me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A little more surprise, but no reproach, was expressed in her face,
as she withdrew to the other side of the table, and took a small packet
of needlework from her basket.&nbsp; But she laid it down again, on
second thoughts, and going noiselessly about the room, set everything
exactly in its place, and in the neatest order; even to the cushions
on the couch, which she touched with so light a hand, that he hardly
seemed to know it, as he lay looking at the fire.&nbsp; When all this
was done, and she had swept the hearth, she sat down, in her modest
little bonnet, to her work, and was quietly busy on it directly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the new muslin curtain for the window, Mr. Edmund,&rdquo;
said Milly, stitching away as she talked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will look
very clean and nice, though it costs very little, and will save your
eyes, too, from the light.&nbsp; My William says the room should not
be too light just now, when you are recovering so well, or the glare
might make you giddy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He said nothing; but there was something so fretful and impatient in
his change of position, that her quick fingers stopped, and she looked
at him anxiously.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The pillows are not comfortable,&rdquo; she said, laying down
her work and rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will soon put them right.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They are very well,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave them
alone, pray.&nbsp; You make so much of everything.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He raised his head to say this, and looked at her so thanklessly, that,
after he had thrown himself down again, she stood timidly pausing.&nbsp;
However, she resumed her seat, and her needle, without having directed
even a murmuring look towards him, and was soon as busy as before.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have been thinking, Mr. Edmund, that <i>you</i> have been often
thinking of late, when I have been sitting by, how true the saying is,
that adversity is a good teacher.&nbsp; Health will be more precious
to you, after this illness, than it has ever been.&nbsp; And years hence,
when this time of year comes round, and you remember the days when you
lay here sick, alone, that the knowledge of your illness might not afflict
those who are dearest to you, your home will be doubly dear and doubly
blest.&nbsp; Now, isn&rsquo;t that a good, true thing?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She was too intent upon her work, and too earnest in what she said,
and too composed and quiet altogether, to be on the watch for any look
he might direct towards her in reply; so the shaft of his ungrateful
glance fell harmless, and did not wound her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Milly, with her pretty head inclining thoughtfully
on one side, as she looked down, following her busy fingers with her
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even on me - and I am very different from you, Mr.
Edmund, for I have no learning, and don&rsquo;t know how to think properly
- this view of such things has made a great impression, since you have
been lying ill.&nbsp; When I have seen you so touched by the kindness
and attention of the poor people down stairs, I have felt that you thought
even that experience some repayment for the loss of health, and I have
read in your face, as plain as if it was a book, that but for some trouble
and sorrow we should never know half the good there is about us.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His getting up from the couch, interrupted her, or she was going on
to say more.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t magnify the merit, Mrs. William,&rdquo; he rejoined
slightingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people down stairs will be paid in good
time I dare say, for any little extra service they may have rendered
me; and perhaps they anticipate no less.&nbsp; I am much obliged to
you, too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Her fingers stopped, and she looked at him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be made to feel the more obliged by your exaggerating
the case,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sensible that you have been
interested in me, and I say I am much obliged to you.&nbsp; What more
would you have?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Her work fell on her lap, as she still looked at him walking to and
fro with an intolerant air, and stopping now and then.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I say again, I am much obliged to you.&nbsp; Why weaken my sense
of what is your due in obligation, by preferring enormous claims upon
me?&nbsp; Trouble, sorrow, affliction, adversity!&nbsp; One might suppose
I had been dying a score of deaths here!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you believe, Mr. Edmund,&rdquo; she asked, rising and going
nearer to him, &ldquo;that I spoke of the poor people of the house,
with any reference to myself?&nbsp; To me?&rdquo; laying her hand upon
her bosom with a simple and innocent smile of astonishment.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I think nothing about it, my good creature,&rdquo;
he returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have had an indisposition, which your solicitude
- observe! I say solicitude - makes a great deal more of, than it merits;
and it&rsquo;s over, and we can&rsquo;t perpetuate it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He coldly took a book, and sat down at the table.<br>
<br>
She watched him for a little while, until her smile was quite gone,
and then, returning to where her basket was, said gently:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Edmund, would you rather be alone?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is no reason why I should detain you here,&rdquo; he replied.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Except - &rdquo; said Milly, hesitating, and showing her work.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh! the curtain,&rdquo; he answered, with a supercilious laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not worth staying for.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She made up the little packet again, and put it in her basket.&nbsp;
Then, standing before him with such an air of patient entreaty that
he could not choose but look at her, she said:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If you should want me, I will come back willingly.&nbsp; When
you did want me, I was quite happy to come; there was no merit in it.&nbsp;
I think you must be afraid, that, now you are getting well, I may be
troublesome to you; but I should not have been, indeed.&nbsp; I should
have come no longer than your weakness and confinement lasted.&nbsp;
You owe me nothing; but it is right that you should deal as justly by
me as if I was a lady - even the very lady that you love; and if you
suspect me of meanly making much of the little I have tried to do to
comfort your sick room, you do yourself more wrong than ever you can
do me.&nbsp; That is why I am sorry.&nbsp; That is why I am very sorry.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
If she had been as passionate as she was quiet, as indignant as she
was calm, as angry in her look as she was gentle, as loud of tone as
she was low and clear, she might have left no sense of her departure
in the room, compared with that which fell upon the lonely student when
she went away.<br>
<br>
He was gazing drearily upon the place where she had been, when Redlaw
came out of his concealment, and came to the door.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When sickness lays its hand on you again,&rdquo; he said, looking
fiercely back at him, &ldquo; - may it be soon! - Die here!&nbsp; Rot
here!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; returned the other, catching at his
cloak.&nbsp; &ldquo;What change have you wrought in me?&nbsp; What curse
have you brought upon me?&nbsp; Give me back <i>my</i>self!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Give me back myself!&rdquo; exclaimed Redlaw like a madman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am infected!&nbsp; I am infectious!&nbsp; I am charged with
poison for my own mind, and the minds of all mankind.&nbsp; Where I
felt interest, compassion, sympathy, I am turning into stone.&nbsp;
Selfishness and ingratitude spring up in my blighting footsteps.&nbsp;
I am only so much less base than the wretches whom I make so, that in
the moment of their transformation I can hate them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As he spoke - the young man still holding to his cloak - he cast him
off, and struck him: then, wildly hurried out into the night air where
the wind was blowing, the snow falling, the cloud-drift sweeping on,
the moon dimly shining; and where, blowing in the wind, falling with
the snow, drifting with the clouds, shining in the moonlight, and heavily
looming in the darkness, were the Phantom&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;The
gift that I have given, you shall give again, go where you will!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Whither he went, he neither knew nor cared, so that he avoided company.&nbsp;
The change he felt within him made the busy streets a desert, and himself
a desert, and the multitude around him, in their manifold endurances
and ways of life, a mighty waste of sand, which the winds tossed into
unintelligible heaps and made a ruinous confusion of.&nbsp; Those traces
in his breast which the Phantom had told him would &ldquo;die out soon,&rdquo;
were not, as yet, so far upon their way to death, but that he understood
enough of what he was, and what he made of others, to desire to be alone.<br>
<br>
This put it in his mind - he suddenly bethought himself, as he was going
along, of the boy who had rushed into his room.&nbsp; And then he recollected,
that of those with whom he had communicated since the Phantom&rsquo;s
disappearance, that boy alone had shown no sign of being changed.<br>
<br>
Monstrous and odious as the wild thing was to him, he determined to
seek it out, and prove if this were really so; and also to seek it with
another intention, which came into his thoughts at the same time.<br>
<br>
So, resolving with some difficulty where he was, he directed his steps
back to the old college, and to that part of it where the general porch
was, and where, alone, the pavement was worn by the tread of the students&rsquo;
feet.<br>
<br>
The keeper&rsquo;s house stood just within the iron gates, forming a
part of the chief quadrangle.&nbsp; There was a little cloister outside,
and from that sheltered place he knew he could look in at the window
of their ordinary room, and see who was within.&nbsp; The iron gates
were shut, but his hand was familiar with the fastening, and drawing
it back by thrusting in his wrist between the bars, he passed through
softly, shut it again, and crept up to the window, crumbling the thin
crust of snow with his feet.<br>
<br>
The fire, to which he had directed the boy last night, shining brightly
through the glass, made an illuminated place upon the ground.&nbsp;
Instinctively avoiding this, and going round it, he looked in at the
window.&nbsp; At first, he thought that there was no one there, and
that the blaze was reddening only the old beams in the ceiling and the
dark walls; but peering in more narrowly, he saw the object of his search
coiled asleep before it on the floor.&nbsp; He passed quickly to the
door, opened it, and went in.<br>
<br>
The creature lay in such a fiery heat, that, as the Chemist stooped
to rouse him, it scorched his head.&nbsp; So soon as he was touched,
the boy, not half awake, clutching his rags together with the instinct
of flight upon him, half rolled and half ran into a distant corner of
the room, where, heaped upon the ground, he struck his foot out to defend
himself.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; said the Chemist.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have not forgotten
me?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You let me alone!&rdquo; returned the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is the woman&rsquo;s house - not yours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist&rsquo;s steady eye controlled him somewhat, or inspired
him with enough submission to be raised upon his feet, and looked at.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who washed them, and put those bandages where they were bruised
and cracked?&rdquo; asked the Chemist, pointing to their altered state.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The woman did.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And is it she who has made you cleaner in the face, too?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, the woman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw asked these questions to attract his eyes towards himself, and
with the same intent now held him by the chin, and threw his wild hair
back, though he loathed to touch him.&nbsp; The boy watched his eyes
keenly, as if he thought it needful to his own defence, not knowing
what he might do next; and Redlaw could see well that no change came
over him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he inquired.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I know she is.&nbsp; Where is the old man with the white hair,
and his son?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s husband, d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; inquired the
boy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay.&nbsp; Where are those two?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Out.&nbsp; Something&rsquo;s the matter, somewhere.&nbsp; They
were fetched out in a hurry, and told me to stop here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said the Chemist, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
give you money.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come where? and how much will you give?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you more shillings than you ever saw, and bring
you back soon.&nbsp; Do you know your way to where you came from?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You let me go,&rdquo; returned the boy, suddenly twisting out
of his grasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a going to take you there.&nbsp;
Let me be, or I&rsquo;ll heave some fire at you!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He was down before it, and ready, with his savage little hand, to pluck
the burning coals out.<br>
<br>
What the Chemist had felt, in observing the effect of his charmed influence
stealing over those with whom he came in contact, was not nearly equal
to the cold vague terror with which he saw this baby-monster put it
at defiance.&nbsp; It chilled his blood to look on the immovable impenetrable
thing, in the likeness of a child, with its sharp malignant face turned
up to his, and its almost infant hand, ready at the bars.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Listen, boy!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall take me where
you please, so that you take me where the people are very miserable
or very wicked.&nbsp; I want to do them good, and not to harm them.&nbsp;
You shall have money, as I have told you, and I will bring you back.&nbsp;
Get up!&nbsp; Come quickly!&rdquo;&nbsp; He made a hasty step towards
the door, afraid of her returning.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Will you let me walk by myself, and never hold me, nor yet touch
me?&rdquo; said the boy, slowly withdrawing the hand with which he threatened,
and beginning to get up.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And let me go, before, behind, or anyways I like?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Give me some money first, then, and go.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist laid a few shillings, one by one, in his extended hand.&nbsp;
To count them was beyond the boy&rsquo;s knowledge, but he said &ldquo;one,&rdquo;
every time, and avariciously looked at each as it was given, and at
the donor.&nbsp; He had nowhere to put them, out of his hand, but in
his mouth; and he put them there.<br>
<br>
Redlaw then wrote with his pencil on a leaf of his pocket-book, that
the boy was with him; and laying it on the table, signed to him to follow.&nbsp;
Keeping his rags together, as usual, the boy complied, and went out
with his bare head and naked feet into the winter night.<br>
<br>
Preferring not to depart by the iron gate by which he had entered, where
they were in danger of meeting her whom he so anxiously avoided, the
Chemist led the way, through some of those passages among which the
boy had lost himself, and by that portion of the building where he lived,
to a small door of which he had the key.&nbsp; When they got into the
street, he stopped to ask his guide - who instantly retreated from him
- if he knew where they were.<br>
<br>
The savage thing looked here and there, and at length, nodding his head,
pointed in the direction he designed to take.&nbsp; Redlaw going on
at once, he followed, something less suspiciously; shifting his money
from his mouth into his hand, and back again into his mouth, and stealthily
rubbing it bright upon his shreds of dress, as he went along.<br>
<br>
Three times, in their progress, they were side by side.&nbsp; Three
times they stopped, being side by side.&nbsp; Three times the Chemist
glanced down at his face, and shuddered as it forced upon him one reflection.<br>
<br>
The first occasion was when they were crossing an old churchyard, and
Redlaw stopped among the graves, utterly at a loss how to connect them
with any tender, softening, or consolatory thought.<br>
<br>
The second was, when the breaking forth of the moon induced him to look
up at the Heavens, where he saw her in her glory, surrounded by a host
of stars he still knew by the names and histories which human science
has appended to them; but where he saw nothing else he had been wont
to see, felt nothing he had been wont to feel, in looking up there,
on a bright night.<br>
<br>
The third was when he stopped to listen to a plaintive strain of music,
but could only hear a tune, made manifest to him by the dry mechanism
of the instruments and his own ears, with no address to any mystery
within him, without a whisper in it of the past, or of the future, powerless
upon him as the sound of last year&rsquo;s running water, or the rushing
of last year&rsquo;s wind.<br>
<br>
At each of these three times, he saw with horror that, in spite of the
vast intellectual distance between them, and their being unlike each
other in all physical respects, the expression on the boy&rsquo;s face
was the expression on his own.<br>
<br>
They journeyed on for some time - now through such crowded places, that
he often looked over his shoulder thinking he had lost his guide, but
generally finding him within his shadow on his other side; now by ways
so quiet, that he could have counted his short, quick, naked footsteps
coming on behind - until they arrived at a ruinous collection of houses,
and the boy touched him and stopped.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In there!&rdquo; he said, pointing out one house where there
were shattered lights in the windows, and a dim lantern in the doorway,
with &ldquo;Lodgings for Travellers&rdquo; painted on it.<br>
<br>
Redlaw looked about him; from the houses to the waste piece of ground
on which the houses stood, or rather did not altogether tumble down,
unfenced, undrained, unlighted, and bordered by a sluggish ditch; from
that, to the sloping line of arches, part of some neighbouring viaduct
or bridge with which it was surrounded, and which lessened gradually
towards them, until the last but one was a mere kennel for a dog, the
last a plundered little heap of bricks; from that, to the child, close
to him, cowering and trembling with the cold, and limping on one little
foot, while he coiled the other round his leg to warm it, yet staring
at all these things with that frightful likeness of expression so apparent
in his face, that Redlaw started from him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In there!&rdquo; said the boy, pointing out the house again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Will they let me in?&rdquo; asked Redlaw.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re a doctor,&rdquo; he answered with a nod.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty ill here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Looking back on his way to the house-door, Redlaw saw him trail himself
upon the dust and crawl within the shelter of the smallest arch, as
if he were a rat.&nbsp; He had no pity for the thing, but he was afraid
of it; and when it looked out of its den at him, he hurried to the house
as a retreat.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sorrow, wrong, and trouble,&rdquo; said the Chemist, with a painful
effort at some more distinct remembrance, &ldquo;at least haunt this
place darkly.&nbsp; He can do no harm, who brings forgetfulness of such
things here!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
With these words, he pushed the yielding door, and went in.<br>
<br>
There was a woman sitting on the stairs, either asleep or forlorn, whose
head was bent down on her hands and knees.&nbsp; As it was not easy
to pass without treading on her, and as she was perfectly regardless
of his near approach, he stopped, and touched her on the shoulder.&nbsp;
Looking up, she showed him quite a young face, but one whose bloom and
promise were all swept away, as if the haggard winter should unnaturally
kill the spring.<br>
<br>
With little or no show of concern on his account, she moved nearer to
the wall to leave him a wider passage.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; said Redlaw, pausing, with his hand upon
the broken stair-rail.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What do you think I am?&rdquo; she answered, showing him her
face again.<br>
<br>
He looked upon the ruined Temple of God, so lately made, so soon disfigured;
and something, which was not compassion - for the springs in which a
true compassion for such miseries has its rise, were dried up in his
breast - but which was nearer to it, for the moment, than any feeling
that had lately struggled into the darkening, but not yet wholly darkened,
night of his mind - mingled a touch of softness with his next words.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am come here to give relief, if I can,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you thinking of any wrong?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She frowned at him, and then laughed; and then her laugh prolonged itself
into a shivering sigh, as she dropped her head again, and hid her fingers
in her hair.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Are you thinking of a wrong?&rdquo; he asked once more.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am thinking of my life,&rdquo; she said, with a monetary look
at him.<br>
<br>
He had a perception that she was one of many, and that he saw the type
of thousands, when he saw her, drooping at his feet.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What are your parents?&rdquo; he demanded.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I had a good home once.&nbsp; My father was a gardener, far away,
in the country.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead to me.&nbsp; All such things are dead to me.&nbsp;
You a gentleman, and not know that!&rdquo;&nbsp; She raised her eyes
again, and laughed at him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Girl!&rdquo; said Redlaw, sternly, &ldquo;before this death,
of all such things, was brought about, was there no wrong done to you?&nbsp;
In spite of all that you can do, does no remembrance of wrong cleave
to you?&nbsp; Are there not times upon times when it is misery to you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
So little of what was womanly was left in her appearance, that now,
when she burst into tears, he stood amazed.&nbsp; But he was more amazed,
and much disquieted, to note that in her awakened recollection of this
wrong, the first trace of her old humanity and frozen tenderness appeared
to show itself.<br>
<br>
He drew a little off, and in doing so, observed that her arms were black,
her face cut, and her bosom bruised.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What brutal hand has hurt you so?&rdquo; he asked.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My own.&nbsp; I did it myself!&rdquo; she answered quickly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is impossible.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I did!&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t touch me.&nbsp;
I did it to myself in a passion, and threw myself down here.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t near me.&nbsp; He never laid a hand upon me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the white determination of her face, confronting him with this untruth,
he saw enough of the last perversion and distortion of good surviving
in that miserable breast, to be stricken with remorse that he had ever
come near her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sorrow, wrong, and trouble!&rdquo; he muttered, turning his fearful
gaze away.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that connects her with the state from which
she has fallen, has those roots!&nbsp; In the name of God, let me go
by!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Afraid to look at her again, afraid to touch her, afraid to think of
having sundered the last thread by which she held upon the mercy of
Heaven, he gathered his cloak about him, and glided swiftly up the stairs.<br>
<br>
Opposite to him, on the landing, was a door, which stood partly open,
and which, as he ascended, a man with a candle in his hand, came forward
from within to shut.&nbsp; But this man, on seeing him, drew back, with
much emotion in his manner, and, as if by a sudden impulse, mentioned
his name aloud.<br>
<br>
In the surprise of such a recognition there, he stopped, endeavouring
to recollect the wan and startled face.&nbsp; He had no time to consider
it, for, to his yet greater amazement, old Philip came out of the room,
and took him by the hand.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Redlaw,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;this is like you,
this is like you, sir! you have heard of it, and have come after us
to render any help you can.&nbsp; Ah, too late, too late!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw, with a bewildered look, submitted to be led into the room.&nbsp;
A man lay there, on a truckle-bed, and William Swidger stood at the
bedside.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; murmured the old man, looking wistfully into
the Chemist&rsquo;s face; and the tears stole down his cheeks.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say, father,&rdquo; interposed his son in
a low voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it is, exactly.&nbsp; To
keep as quiet as ever we can while he&rsquo;s a dozing, is the only
thing to do.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right, father!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw paused at the bedside, and looked down on the figure that was
stretched upon the mattress.&nbsp; It was that of a man, who should
have been in the vigour of his life, but on whom it was not likely the
sun would ever shine again.&nbsp; The vices of his forty or fifty years&rsquo;
career had so branded him, that, in comparison with their effects upon
his face, the heavy hand of Time upon the old man&rsquo;s face who watched
him had been merciful and beautifying.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; asked the Chemist, looking round.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My son George, Mr. Redlaw,&rdquo; said the old man, wringing
his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;My eldest son, George, who was more his mother&rsquo;s
pride than all the rest!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw&rsquo;s eyes wandered from the old man&rsquo;s grey head, as
he laid it down upon the bed, to the person who had recognised him,
and who had kept aloof, in the remotest corner of the room.&nbsp; He
seemed to be about his own age; and although he knew no such hopeless
decay and broken man as he appeared to be, there was something in the
turn of his figure, as he stood with his back towards him, and now went
out at the door, that made him pass his hand uneasily across his brow.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;William,&rdquo; he said in a gloomy whisper, &ldquo;who is that
man?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why you see, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. William, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
what I say, myself.&nbsp; Why should a man ever go and gamble, and the
like of that, and let himself down inch by inch till he can&rsquo;t
let himself down any lower!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Has <i>he</i> done so?&rdquo; asked Redlaw, glancing after him
with the same uneasy action as before.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Just exactly that, sir,&rdquo; returned William Swidger, &ldquo;as
I&rsquo;m told.&nbsp; He knows a little about medicine, sir, it seems;
and having been wayfaring towards London with my unhappy brother that
you see here,&rdquo; Mr. William passed his coat-sleeve across his eyes,
&ldquo;and being lodging up stairs for the night - what I say, you see,
is that strange companions come together here sometimes - he looked
in to attend upon him, and came for us at his request.&nbsp; What a
mournful spectacle, sir!&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s where it is.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
enough to kill my father!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw looked up, at these words, and, recalling where he was and with
whom, and the spell he carried with him - which his surprise had obscured
- retired a little, hurriedly, debating with himself whether to shun
the house that moment, or remain.<br>
<br>
Yielding to a certain sullen doggedness, which it seemed to be a part
of his condition to struggle with, he argued for remaining.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Was it only yesterday,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I observed
the memory of this old man to be a tissue of sorrow and trouble, and
shall I be afraid, to-night, to shake it?&nbsp; Are such remembrances
as I can drive away, so precious to this dying man that I need fear
for <i>him</i>?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But he stayed in fear and trembling none the less for these words; and,
shrouded in his black cloak with his face turned from them, stood away
from the bedside, listening to what they said, as if he felt himself
a demon in the place.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; murmured the sick man, rallying a little from
stupor.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My boy!&nbsp; My son George!&rdquo; said old Philip.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You spoke, just now, of my being mother&rsquo;s favourite, long
ago.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing to think now, of long ago!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no, no;&rdquo; returned the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think of
it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s dreadful.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not
dreadful to me, my son.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It cuts you to the heart, father.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the old man&rsquo;s
tears were falling on him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;so it does; but it does
me good.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a heavy sorrow to think of that time, but
it does me good, George.&nbsp; Oh, think of it too, think of it too,
and your heart will be softened more and more!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my
son William?&nbsp; William, my boy, your mother loved him dearly to
the last, and with her latest breath said, &lsquo;Tell him I forgave
him, blessed him, and prayed for him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those were her words
to me.&nbsp; I have never forgotten them, and I&rsquo;m eighty-seven!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said the man upon the bed, &ldquo;I am dying,
I know.&nbsp; I am so far gone, that I can hardly speak, even of what
my mind most runs on.&nbsp; Is there any hope for me beyond this bed?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is hope,&rdquo; returned the old man, &ldquo;for all who
are softened and penitent.&nbsp; There is hope for all such.&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, clasping his hands and looking up, &ldquo;I was thankful,
only yesterday, that I could remember this unhappy son when he was an
innocent child.&nbsp; But what a comfort it is, now, to think that even
God himself has that remembrance of him!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw spread his hands upon his face, and shrank, like a murderer.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; feebly moaned the man upon the bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
waste since then, the waste of life since then!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But he was a child once,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
played with children.&nbsp; Before he lay down on his bed at night,
and fell into his guiltless rest, he said his prayers at his poor mother&rsquo;s
knee.&nbsp; I have seen him do it, many a time; and seen her lay his
head upon her breast, and kiss him.&nbsp; Sorrowful as it was to her
and me, to think of this, when he went so wrong, and when our hopes
and plans for him were all broken, this gave him still a hold upon us,
that nothing else could have given.&nbsp; Oh, Father, so much better
than the fathers upon earth!&nbsp; Oh, Father, so much more afflicted
by the errors of Thy children! take this wanderer back!&nbsp; Not as
he is, but as he was then, let him cry to Thee, as he has so often seemed
to cry to us!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As the old man lifted up his trembling hands, the son, for whom he made
the supplication, laid his sinking head against him for support and
comfort, as if he were indeed the child of whom he spoke.<br>
<br>
When did man ever tremble, as Redlaw trembled, in the silence that ensued!&nbsp;
He knew it must come upon them, knew that it was coming fast.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My time is very short, my breath is shorter,&rdquo; said the
sick man, supporting himself on one arm, and with the other groping
in the air, &ldquo;and I remember there is something on my mind concerning
the man who was here just now, Father and William - wait! - is there
really anything in black, out there?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, it is real,&rdquo; said his aged father.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it a man?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What I say myself, George,&rdquo; interposed his brother, bending
kindly over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Redlaw.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I thought I had dreamed of him.&nbsp; Ask him to come here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist, whiter than the dying man, appeared before him.&nbsp; Obedient
to the motion of his hand, he sat upon the bed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It has been so ripped up, to-night, sir,&rdquo; said the sick
man, laying his hand upon his heart, with a look in which the mute,
imploring agony of his condition was concentrated, &ldquo;by the sight
of my poor old father, and the thought of all the trouble I have been
the cause of, and all the wrong and sorrow lying at my door, that -
&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Was it the extremity to which he had come, or was it the dawning of
another change, that made him stop?<br>
<br>
&ldquo; - that what I <i>can</i> do right, with my mind running on so
much, so fast, I&rsquo;ll try to do. There was another man here.&nbsp;
Did you see him?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw could not reply by any word; for when he saw that fatal sign
he knew so well now, of the wandering hand upon the forehead, his voice
died at his lips.&nbsp; But he made some indication of assent.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He is penniless, hungry, and destitute.&nbsp; He is completely
beaten down, and has no resource at all.&nbsp; Look after him!&nbsp;
Lose no time!&nbsp; I know he has it in his mind to kill himself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was working.&nbsp; It was on his face.&nbsp; His face was changing,
hardening, deepening in all its shades, and losing all its sorrow.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know him?&rdquo;
he pursued.<br>
<br>
He shut his face out for a moment, with the hand that again wandered
over his forehead, and then it lowered on Redlaw, reckless, ruffianly,
and callous.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, d-n you!&rdquo; he said, scowling round, &ldquo;what have
you been doing to me here!&nbsp; I have lived bold, and I mean to die
bold.&nbsp; To the Devil with you!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And so lay down upon his bed, and put his arms up, over his head and
ears, as resolute from that time to keep out all access, and to die
in his indifference.<br>
<br>
If Redlaw had been struck by lightning, it could not have struck him
from the bedside with a more tremendous shock.&nbsp; But the old man,
who had left the bed while his son was speaking to him, now returning,
avoided it quickly likewise, and with abhorrence.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my boy William?&rdquo; said the old man hurriedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;William, come away from here.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Home, father!&rdquo; returned William.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you going
to leave your own son?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my own son?&rdquo; replied the old man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where? why, there!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no son of mine,&rdquo; said Philip, trembling with
resentment.&nbsp; &ldquo;No such wretch as that, has any claim on me.&nbsp;
My children are pleasant to look at, and they wait upon me, and get
my meat and drink ready, and are useful to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a right
to it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m eighty-seven!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re old enough to be no older,&rdquo; muttered William,
looking at him grudgingly, with his hands in his pockets.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what good you are, myself.&nbsp; We could have a deal
more pleasure without you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<i>My</i> son, Mr. Redlaw!&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>My</i>
son, too!&nbsp; The boy talking to me of <i>my</i> son!&nbsp; Why, what
has he ever done to give me any pleasure, I should like to know?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you have ever done to give <i>me</i>
any pleasure,&rdquo; said William, sulkily.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;For how many
Christmas times running, have I sat in my warm place, and never had
to come out in the cold night air; and have made good cheer, without
being disturbed by any such uncomfortable, wretched sight as him there?&nbsp;
Is it twenty, William?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nigher forty, it seems,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
when I look at my father, sir, and come to think of it,&rdquo; addressing
Redlaw, with an impatience and irritation that were quite new, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
whipped if I can see anything in him but a calendar of ever so many
years of eating and drinking, and making himself comfortable, over and
over again.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I - I&rsquo;m eighty-seven,&rdquo; said the old man, rambling
on, childishly and weakly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know as I ever was
much put out by anything.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to begin now, because
of what he calls my son.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not my son.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
had a power of pleasant times.&nbsp; I recollect once - no I don&rsquo;t
- no, it&rsquo;s broken off.&nbsp; It was something about a game of
cricket and a friend of mine, but it&rsquo;s somehow broken off.&nbsp;
I wonder who he was - I suppose I liked him?&nbsp; And I wonder what
became of him - I suppose he died?&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
And I don&rsquo;t care, neither; I don&rsquo;t care a bit.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In his drowsy chuckling, and the shaking of his head, he put his hands
into his waistcoat pockets.&nbsp; In one of them he found a bit of holly
(left there, probably last night), which he now took out, and looked
at.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Berries, eh?&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a pity they&rsquo;re not good to eat.&nbsp; I recollect,
when I was a little chap about as high as that, and out a walking with
- let me see - who was I out a walking with? - no, I don&rsquo;t remember
how that was.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember as I ever walked with any
one particular, or cared for any one, or any one for me.&nbsp; Berries,
eh?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s good cheer when there&rsquo;s berries.&nbsp;
Well; I ought to have my share of it, and to be waited on, and kept
warm and comfortable; for I&rsquo;m eighty-seven, and a poor old man.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m eigh-ty-seven.&nbsp; Eigh-ty-seven!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The drivelling, pitiable manner in which, as he repeated this, he nibbled
at the leaves, and spat the morsels out; the cold, uninterested eye
with which his youngest son (so changed) regarded him; the determined
apathy with which his eldest son lay hardened in his sin; impressed
themselves no more on Redlaw&rsquo;s observation, - for he broke his
way from the spot to which his feet seemed to have been fixed, and ran
out of the house.<br>
<br>
His guide came crawling forth from his place of refuge, and was ready
for him before he reached the arches.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Back to the woman&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he inquired.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Back, quickly!&rdquo; answered Redlaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop nowhere
on the way!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
For a short distance the boy went on before; but their return was more
like a flight than a walk, and it was as much as his bare feet could
do, to keep pace with the Chemist&rsquo;s rapid strides.&nbsp; Shrinking
from all who passed, shrouded in his cloak, and keeping it drawn closely
about him, as though there were mortal contagion in any fluttering touch
of his garments, he made no pause until they reached the door by which
they had come out.&nbsp; He unlocked it with his key, went in, accompanied
by the boy, and hastened through the dark passages to his own chamber.<br>
<br>
The boy watched him as he made the door fast, and withdrew behind the
table, when he looked round.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you touch me!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve not brought me here to take my money away.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw threw some more upon the ground.&nbsp; He flung his body on it
immediately, as if to hide it from him, lest the sight of it should
tempt him to reclaim it; and not until he saw him seated by his lamp,
with his face hidden in his hands, began furtively to pick it up.&nbsp;
When he had done so, he crept near the fire, and, sitting down in a
great chair before it, took from his breast some broken scraps of food,
and fell to munching, and to staring at the blaze, and now and then
to glancing at his shillings, which he kept clenched up in a bunch,
in one hand.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said Redlaw, gazing on him with increased repugnance
and fear, &ldquo;is the only one companion I have left on earth!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
How long it was before he was aroused from his contemplation of this
creature, whom he dreaded so - whether half-an-hour, or half the night
- he knew not.&nbsp; But the stillness of the room was broken by the
boy (whom he had seen listening) starting up, and running towards the
door.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the woman coming!&rdquo; he exclaimed.<br>
<br>
The Chemist stopped him on his way, at the moment when she knocked.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Let me go to her, will you?&rdquo; said the boy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; returned the Chemist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay here.&nbsp;
Nobody must pass in or out of the room now.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, sir,&rdquo; cried Milly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir,
let me in!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No! not for the world!&rdquo; he said.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Redlaw, Mr. Redlaw, pray, sir, let me in.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he said, holding the boy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The miserable man you saw, is worse, and nothing I can say will
wake him from his terrible infatuation.&nbsp; William&rsquo;s father
has turned childish in a moment, William himself is changed.&nbsp; The
shock has been too sudden for him; I cannot understand him; he is not
like himself.&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Redlaw, pray advise me, help me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No!&rdquo; he answered.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr.&nbsp; Redlaw!&nbsp; Dear sir!&nbsp; George has been muttering,
in his doze, about the man you saw there, who, he fears, will kill himself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Better he should do it, than come near me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He says, in his wandering, that you know him; that he was your
friend once, long ago; that he is the ruined father of a student here
- my mind misgives me, of the young gentleman who has been ill.&nbsp;
What is to be done?&nbsp; How is he to be followed?&nbsp; How is he
to be saved?&nbsp; Mr. Redlaw, pray, oh, pray, advise me!&nbsp; Help
me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
All this time he held the boy, who was half-mad to pass him, and let
her in.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Phantoms!&nbsp; Punishers of impious thoughts!&rdquo; cried Redlaw,
gazing round in anguish, &ldquo;look upon me!&nbsp; From the darkness
of my mind, let the glimmering of contrition that I know is there, shine
up and show my misery!&nbsp; In the material world as I have long taught,
nothing can be spared; no step or atom in the wondrous structure could
be lost, without a blank being made in the great universe.&nbsp; I know,
now, that it is the same with good and evil, happiness and sorrow, in
the memories of men.&nbsp; Pity me!&nbsp; Relieve me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
There was no response, but her &ldquo;Help me, help me, let me in!&rdquo;
and the boy&rsquo;s struggling to get to her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Shadow of myself!&nbsp; Spirit of my darker hours!&rdquo; cried
Redlaw, in distraction, &ldquo;come back, and haunt me day and night,
but take this gift away!&nbsp; Or, if it must still rest with me, deprive
me of the dreadful power of giving it to others.&nbsp; Undo what I have
done.&nbsp; Leave me benighted, but restore the day to those whom I
have cursed.&nbsp; As I have spared this woman from the first, and as
I never will go forth again, but will die here, with no hand to tend
me, save this creature&rsquo;s who is proof against me, - hear me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The only reply still was, the boy struggling to get to her, while he
held him back; and the cry, increasing in its energy, &ldquo;Help! let
me in.&nbsp; He was your friend once, how shall he be followed, how
shall he be saved?&nbsp; They are all changed, there is no one else
to help me, pray, pray, let me in!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III - The Gift Reversed<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Night was still heavy in the sky.&nbsp; On open plains, from hill-tops,
and from the decks of solitary ships at sea, a distant low-lying line,
that promised by-and-by to change to light, was visible in the dim horizon;
but its promise was remote and doubtful, and the moon was striving with
the night-clouds busily.<br>
<br>
The shadows upon Redlaw&rsquo;s mind succeeded thick and fast to one
another, and obscured its light as the night-clouds hovered between
the moon and earth, and kept the latter veiled in darkness.&nbsp; Fitful
and uncertain as the shadows which the night-clouds cast, were their
concealments from him, and imperfect revelations to him; and, like the
night-clouds still, if the clear light broke forth for a moment, it
was only that they might sweep over it, and make the darkness deeper
than before.<br>
<br>
Without, there was a profound and solemn hush upon the ancient pile
of building, and its buttresses and angles made dark shapes of mystery
upon the ground, which now seemed to retire into the smooth white snow
and now seemed to come out of it, as the moon&rsquo;s path was more
or less beset.&nbsp; Within, the Chemist&rsquo;s room was indistinct
and murky, by the light of the expiring lamp; a ghostly silence had
succeeded to the knocking and the voice outside; nothing was audible
but, now and then, a low sound among the whitened ashes of the fire,
as of its yielding up its last breath.&nbsp; Before it on the ground
the boy lay fast asleep.&nbsp; In his chair, the Chemist sat, as he
had sat there since the calling at his door had ceased - like a man
turned to stone.<br>
<br>
At such a time, the Christmas music he had heard before, began to play.&nbsp;
He listened to it at first, as he had listened in the church-yard; but
presently - it playing still, and being borne towards him on the night
air, in a low, sweet, melancholy strain - he rose, and stood stretching
his hands about him, as if there were some friend approaching within
his reach, on whom his desolate touch might rest, yet do no harm.&nbsp;
As he did this, his face became less fixed and wondering; a gentle trembling
came upon him; and at last his eyes filled with tears, and he put his
hands before them, and bowed down his head.<br>
<br>
His memory of sorrow, wrong, and trouble, had not come back to him;
he knew that it was not restored; he had no passing belief or hope that
it was.&nbsp; But some dumb stir within him made him capable, again,
of being moved by what was hidden, afar off, in the music.&nbsp; If
it were only that it told him sorrowfully the value of what he had lost,
he thanked Heaven for it with a fervent gratitude.<br>
<br>
As the last chord died upon his ear, he raised his head to listen to
its lingering vibration.&nbsp; Beyond the boy, so that his sleeping
figure lay at its feet, the Phantom stood, immovable and silent, with
its eyes upon him.<br>
<br>
Ghastly it was, as it had ever been, but not so cruel and relentless
in its aspect - or he thought or hoped so, as he looked upon it trembling.&nbsp;
It was not alone, but in its shadowy hand it held another hand.<br>
<br>
And whose was that?&nbsp; Was the form that stood beside it indeed Milly&rsquo;s,
or but her shade and picture?&nbsp; The quiet head was bent a little,
as her manner was, and her eyes were looking down, as if in pity, on
the sleeping child.&nbsp; A radiant light fell on her face, but did
not touch the Phantom; for, though close beside her, it was dark and
colourless as ever.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Spectre!&rdquo; said the Chemist, newly troubled as he looked,
&ldquo;I have not been stubborn or presumptuous in respect of her.&nbsp;
Oh, do not bring her here.&nbsp; Spare me that!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is but a shadow,&rdquo; said the Phantom; &ldquo;when the
morning shines seek out the reality whose image I present before you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it my inexorable doom to do so?&rdquo; cried the Chemist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the Phantom.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To destroy her peace, her goodness; to make her what I am myself,
and what I have made of others!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have said seek her out,&rdquo; returned the Phantom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have said no more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, tell me,&rdquo; exclaimed Redlaw, catching at the hope which
he fancied might lie hidden in the words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I undo what
I have done?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the Phantom.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do not ask for restoration to myself,&rdquo; said Redlaw.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What I abandoned, I abandoned of my own free will, and have justly
lost.&nbsp; But for those to whom I have transferred the fatal gift;
who never sought it; who unknowingly received a curse of which they
had no warning, and which they had no power to shun; can I do nothing?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the Phantom.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If I cannot, can any one?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Phantom, standing like a statue, kept its gaze upon him for a while;
then turned its head suddenly, and looked upon the shadow at its side.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Can she?&rdquo; cried Redlaw, still looking upon the
shade.<br>
<br>
The Phantom released the hand it had retained till now, and softly raised
its own with a gesture of dismissal.&nbsp; Upon that, her shadow, still
preserving the same attitude, began to move or melt away.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; cried Redlaw with an earnestness to which he could
not give enough expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;For a moment!&nbsp; As an act
of mercy!&nbsp; I know that some change fell upon me, when those sounds
were in the air just now.&nbsp; Tell me, have I lost the power of harming
her?&nbsp; May I go near her without dread?&nbsp; Oh, let her give me
any sign of hope!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Phantom looked upon the shade as he did - not at him - and gave
no answer.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;At least, say this - has she, henceforth, the consciousness of
any power to set right what I have done?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She has not,&rdquo; the Phantom answered.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Has she the power bestowed on her without the consciousness?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The phantom answered: &ldquo;Seek her out.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And her shadow slowly vanished.<br>
<br>
They were face to face again, and looking on each other, as intently
and awfully as at the time of the bestowal of the gift, across the boy
who still lay on the ground between them, at the Phantom&rsquo;s feet.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Terrible instructor,&rdquo; said the Chemist, sinking on his
knee before it, in an attitude of supplication, &ldquo;by whom I was
renounced, but by whom I am revisited (in which, and in whose milder
aspect, I would fain believe I have a gleam of hope), I will obey without
inquiry, praying that the cry I have sent up in the anguish of my soul
has been, or will be, heard, in behalf of those whom I have injured
beyond human reparation.&nbsp; But there is one thing - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You speak to me of what is lying here,&rdquo; the phantom interposed,
and pointed with its finger to the boy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; returned the Chemist.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know what
I would ask.&nbsp; Why has this child alone been proof against my influence,
and why, why, have I detected in its thoughts a terrible companionship
with mine?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the Phantom, pointing to the boy, &ldquo;is
the last, completest illustration of a human creature, utterly bereft
of such remembrances as you have yielded up.&nbsp; No softening memory
of sorrow, wrong, or trouble enters here, because this wretched mortal
from his birth has been abandoned to a worse condition than the beasts,
and has, within his knowledge, no one contrast, no humanising touch,
to make a grain of such a memory spring up in his hardened breast.&nbsp;
All within this desolate creature is barren wilderness.&nbsp; All within
the man bereft of what you have resigned, is the same barren wilderness.&nbsp;
Woe to such a man!&nbsp; Woe, tenfold, to the nation that shall count
its monsters such as this, lying here, by hundreds and by thousands!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw shrank, appalled, from what he heard.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is not,&rdquo; said the Phantom, &ldquo;one of these -
not one - but sows a harvest that mankind MUST reap.&nbsp; From every
seed of evil in this boy, a field of ruin is grown that shall be gathered
in, and garnered up, and sown again in many places in the world, until
regions are overspread with wickedness enough to raise the waters of
another Deluge.&nbsp; Open and unpunished murder in a city&rsquo;s streets
would be less guilty in its daily toleration, than one such spectacle
as this.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It seemed to look down upon the boy in his sleep.&nbsp; Redlaw, too,
looked down upon him with a new emotion.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is not a father,&rdquo; said the Phantom, &ldquo;by whose
side in his daily or his nightly walk, these creatures pass; there is
not a mother among all the ranks of loving mothers in this land; there
is no one risen from the state of childhood, but shall be responsible
in his or her degree for this enormity.&nbsp; There is not a country
throughout the earth on which it would not bring a curse.&nbsp; There
is no religion upon earth that it would not deny; there is no people
upon earth it would not put to shame.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist clasped his hands, and looked, with trembling fear and pity,
from the sleeping boy to the Phantom, standing above him with his finger
pointing down.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Behold, I say,&rdquo; pursued the Spectre, &ldquo;the perfect
type of what it was your choice to be.&nbsp; Your influence is powerless
here, because from this child&rsquo;s bosom you can banish nothing.&nbsp;
His thoughts have been in &lsquo;terrible companionship&rsquo; with
yours, because you have gone down to his unnatural level.&nbsp; He is
the growth of man&rsquo;s indifference; you are the growth of man&rsquo;s
presumption.&nbsp; The beneficent design of Heaven is, in each case,
overthrown, and from the two poles of the immaterial world you come
together.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist stooped upon the ground beside the boy, and, with the same
kind of compassion for him that he now felt for himself, covered him
as he slept, and no longer shrank from him with abhorrence or indifference.<br>
<br>
Soon, now, the distant line on the horizon brightened, the darkness
faded, the sun rose red and glorious, and the chimney stacks and gables
of the ancient building gleamed in the clear air, which turned the smoke
and vapour of the city into a cloud of gold.&nbsp; The very sun-dial
in his shady corner, where the wind was used to spin with such unwindy
constancy, shook off the finer particles of snow that had accumulated
on his dull old face in the night, and looked out at the little white
wreaths eddying round and round him.&nbsp; Doubtless some blind groping
of the morning made its way down into the forgotten crypt so cold and
earthy, where the Norman arches were half buried in the ground, and
stirred the dull sap in the lazy vegetation hanging to the walls, and
quickened the slow principle of life within the little world of wonderful
and delicate creation which existed there, with some faint knowledge
that the sun was up.<br>
<br>
The Tetterbys were up, and doing.&nbsp; Mr. Tetterby took down the shutters
of the shop, and, strip by strip, revealed the treasures of the window
to the eyes, so proof against their seductions, of Jerusalem Buildings.&nbsp;
Adolphus had been out so long already, that he was halfway on to &ldquo;Morning
Pepper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Five small Tetterbys, whose ten round eyes were
much inflamed by soap and friction, were in the tortures of a cool wash
in the back kitchen; Mrs. Tetterby presiding.&nbsp; Johnny, who was
pushed and hustled through his toilet with great rapidity when Moloch
chanced to be in an exacting frame of mind (which was always the case),
staggered up and down with his charge before the shop door, under greater
difficulties than usual; the weight of Moloch being much increased by
a complication of defences against the cold, composed of knitted worsted-work,
and forming a complete suit of chain-armour, with a head-piece and blue
gaiters.<br>
<br>
It was a peculiarity of this baby to be always cutting teeth.&nbsp;
Whether they never came, or whether they came and went away again, is
not in evidence; but it had certainly cut enough, on the showing of
Mrs. Tetterby, to make a handsome dental provision for the sign of the
Bull and Mouth.&nbsp; All sorts of objects were impressed for the rubbing
of its gums, notwithstanding that it always carried, dangling at its
waist (which was immediately under its chin), a bone ring, large enough
to have represented the rosary of a young nun.&nbsp; Knife-handles,
umbrella-tops, the heads of walking-sticks selected from the stock,
the fingers of the family in general, but especially of Johnny, nutmeg-graters,
crusts, the handles of doors, and the cool knobs on the tops of pokers,
were among the commonest instruments indiscriminately applied for this
baby&rsquo;s relief.&nbsp; The amount of electricity that must have
been rubbed out of it in a week, is not to be calculated.&nbsp; Still
Mrs. Tetterby always said &ldquo;it was coming through, and then the
child would be herself;&rdquo; and still it never did come through,
and the child continued to be somebody else.<br>
<br>
The tempers of the little Tetterbys had sadly changed with a few hours.&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby themselves were not more altered than their offspring.&nbsp;
Usually they were an unselfish, good-natured, yielding little race,
sharing short commons when it happened (which was pretty often) contentedly
and even generously, and taking a great deal of enjoyment out of a very
little meat.&nbsp; But they were fighting now, not only for the soap
and water, but even for the breakfast which was yet in perspective.&nbsp;
The hand of every little Tetterby was against the other little Tetterbys;
and even Johnny&rsquo;s hand - the patient, much-enduring, and devoted
Johnny - rose against the baby!&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Tetterby, going to the
door by mere accident, saw him viciously pick out a weak place in the
suit of armour where a slap would tell, and slap that blessed child.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby had him into the parlour by the collar, in that same flash
of time, and repaid him the assault with usury thereto.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You brute, you murdering little boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had you the heart to do it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t her teeth come through, then,&rdquo; retorted
Johnny, in a loud rebellious voice, &ldquo;instead of bothering me?&nbsp;
How would you like it yourself?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Like it, sir!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, relieving him of his
dishonoured load.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, like it,&rdquo; said Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would you?&nbsp;
Not at all.&nbsp; If you was me, you&rsquo;d go for a soldier.&nbsp;
I will, too.&nbsp; There an&rsquo;t no babies in the Army.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby, who had arrived upon the scene of action, rubbed his chin
thoughtfully, instead of correcting the rebel, and seemed rather struck
by this view of a military life.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wish I was in the Army myself, if the child&rsquo;s in the
right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, looking at her husband, &ldquo;for
I have no peace of my life here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a slave - a Virginia
slave:&rdquo; some indistinct association with their weak descent on
the tobacco trade perhaps suggested this aggravated expression to Mrs.
Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never have a holiday, or any pleasure at all,
from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end!&nbsp; Why, Lord bless and
save the child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, shaking the baby with an
irritability hardly suited to so pious an aspiration, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
the matter with her now?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Not being able to discover, and not rendering the subject much clearer
by shaking it, Mrs. Tetterby put the baby away in a cradle, and, folding
her arms, sat rocking it angrily with her foot.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How you stand there, &rsquo;Dolphus,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby
to her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do something?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t care about doing anything,&rdquo; Mr. Tetterby
replied.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am sure <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my oath <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr.
Tetterby.<br>
<br>
A diversion arose here among Johnny and his five younger brothers, who,
in preparing the family breakfast table, had fallen to skirmishing for
the temporary possession of the loaf, and were buffeting one another
with great heartiness; the smallest boy of all, with precocious discretion,
hovering outside the knot of combatants, and harassing their legs.&nbsp;
Into the midst of this fray, Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby both precipitated
themselves with great ardour, as if such ground were the only ground
on which they could now agree; and having, with no visible remains of
their late soft-heartedness, laid about them without any lenity, and
done much execution, resumed their former relative positions.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You had better read your paper than do nothing at all,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to read in a paper?&rdquo; returned Mr. Tetterby,
with excessive discontent.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Police.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me,&rdquo; said Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
do I care what people do, or are done to?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Suicides,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No business of mine,&rdquo; replied her husband.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Births, deaths, and marriages, are those nothing to you?&rdquo;
said Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If the births were all over for good, and all to-day; and the
deaths were all to begin to come off to-morrow; I don&rsquo;t see why
it should interest me, till I thought it was a coming to my turn,&rdquo;
grumbled Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to marriages, I&rsquo;ve done it
myself.&nbsp; I know quite enough about <i>them</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
To judge from the dissatisfied expression of her face and manner, Mrs.
Tetterby appeared to entertain the same opinions as her husband; but
she opposed him, nevertheless, for the gratification of quarrelling
with him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a consistent man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby,
&ldquo;an&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You, with the screen of your own making
there, made of nothing else but bits of newspapers, which you sit and
read to the children by the half-hour together!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Say used to, if you please,&rdquo; returned her husband.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find me doing so any more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m wiser
now.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Bah! wiser, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you better?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The question sounded some discordant note in Mr. Tetterby&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp;
He ruminated dejectedly, and passed his hand across and across his forehead.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Better!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Tetterby.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know as any of us are better, or happier either.&nbsp; Better, is it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He turned to the screen, and traced about it with his finger, until
he found a certain paragraph of which he was in quest.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This used to be one of the family favourites, I recollect,&rdquo;
said Tetterby, in a forlorn and stupid way, &ldquo;and used to draw
tears from the children, and make &rsquo;em good, if there was any little
bickering or discontent among &rsquo;em, next to the story of the robin
redbreasts in the wood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Melancholy case of destitution.&nbsp;
Yesterday a small man, with a baby in his arms, and surrounded by half-a-dozen
ragged little ones, of various ages between ten and two, the whole of
whom were evidently in a famishing condition, appeared before the worthy
magistrate, and made the following recital:&rsquo; - Ha!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
understand it, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Tetterby; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see what it has got to do with us.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How old and shabby he looks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby, watching
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never saw such a change in a man.&nbsp; Ah! dear
me, dear me, dear me, it was a sacrifice!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What was a sacrifice?&rdquo; her husband sourly inquired.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby shook her head; and without replying in words, raised
a complete sea-storm about the baby, by her violent agitation of the
cradle.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If you mean your marriage was a sacrifice, my good woman - &rdquo;
said her husband.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I <i>do</i> mean it&rdquo; said his wife.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, then I mean to say,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Tetterby, as sulkily
and surlily as she, &ldquo;that there are two sides to that affair;
and that I was the sacrifice; and that I wish the sacrifice hadn&rsquo;t
been accepted.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wish it hadn&rsquo;t, Tetterby, with all my heart and soul
I do assure you,&rdquo; said his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
wish it more than I do, Tetterby.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I saw in her,&rdquo; muttered the newsman,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure; - certainly, if I saw anything, it&rsquo;s not
there now.&nbsp; I was thinking so, last night, after supper, by the
fire.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s fat, she&rsquo;s ageing, she won&rsquo;t bear
comparison with most other women.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s common-looking, he has no air with him, he&rsquo;s
small, he&rsquo;s beginning to stoop and he&rsquo;s getting bald,&rdquo;
muttered Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I must have been half out of my mind when I did it,&rdquo; muttered
Mr. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My senses must have forsook me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only way
in which I can explain it to myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tetterby with
elaboration.<br>
<br>
In this mood they sat down to breakfast.&nbsp; The little Tetterbys
were not habituated to regard that meal in the light of a sedentary
occupation, but discussed it as a dance or trot; rather resembling a
savage ceremony, in the occasionally shrill whoops, and brandishings
of bread and butter, with which it was accompanied, as well as in the
intricate filings off into the street and back again, and the hoppings
up and down the door-steps, which were incidental to the performance.&nbsp;
In the present instance, the contentions between these Tetterby children
for the milk-and-water jug, common to all, which stood upon the table,
presented so lamentable an instance of angry passions risen very high
indeed, that it was an outrage on the memory of Dr. Watts.&nbsp; It
was not until Mr. Tetterby had driven the whole herd out at the front
door, that a moment&rsquo;s peace was secured; and even that was broken
by the discovery that Johnny had surreptitiously come back, and was
at that instant choking in the jug like a ventriloquist, in his indecent
and rapacious haste.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;These children will be the death of me at last!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Tetterby, after banishing the culprit.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the sooner the
better, I think.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Poor people,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;ought not to have
children at all.&nbsp; They give <i>us</i> no pleasure.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He was at that moment taking up the cup which Mrs. Tetterby had rudely
pushed towards him, and Mrs. Tetterby was lifting her own cup to her
lips, when they both stopped, as if they were transfixed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here!&nbsp; Mother!&nbsp; Father!&rdquo; cried Johnny, running
into the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mrs. William coming down the
street!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And if ever, since the world began, a young boy took a baby from a cradle
with the care of an old nurse, and hushed and soothed it tenderly, and
tottered away with it cheerfully, Johnny was that boy, and Moloch was
that baby, as they went out together!<br>
<br>
Mr. Tetterby put down his cup; Mrs. Tetterby put down her cup.&nbsp;
Mr. Tetterby rubbed his forehead; Mrs. Tetterby rubbed hers.&nbsp; Mr.
Tetterby&rsquo;s face began to smooth and brighten; Mrs. Tetterby&rsquo;s
began to smooth and brighten.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, Lord forgive me,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby to himself, &ldquo;what
evil tempers have I been giving way to?&nbsp; What has been the matter
here!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How could I ever treat him ill again, after all I said and felt
last night!&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Tetterby, with her apron to her eyes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Am I a brute,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;or is there any
good in me at all?&nbsp; Sophia!&nbsp; My little woman!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Dolphus dear,&rdquo; returned his wife.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I - I&rsquo;ve been in a state of mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby,
&ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t abear to think of, Sophy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing to what I&rsquo;ve been in, Dolf,&rdquo;
cried his wife in a great burst of grief.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My Sophia,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take
on.&nbsp; I never shall forgive myself.&nbsp; I must have nearly broke
your heart, I know.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, Dolf, no.&nbsp; It was me!&nbsp; Me!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My little woman,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
You make me reproach myself dreadful, when you show such a noble spirit.&nbsp;
Sophia, my dear, you don&rsquo;t know what I thought.&nbsp; I showed
it bad enough, no doubt; but what I thought, my little woman! - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, dear Dolf, don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried his
wife.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sophia,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, &ldquo;I must reveal it.&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t rest in my conscience unless I mentioned it.&nbsp;
My little woman - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mrs. William&rsquo;s very nearly here!&rdquo; screamed Johnny
at the door.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My little woman, I wondered how,&rdquo; gasped Mr. Tetterby,
supporting himself by his chair, &ldquo;I wondered how I had ever admired
you - I forgot the precious children you have brought about me, and
thought you didn&rsquo;t look as slim as I could wish.&nbsp; I - I never
gave a recollection,&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby, with severe self-accusation,
&ldquo;to the cares you&rsquo;ve had as my wife, and along of me and
mine, when you might have had hardly any with another man, who got on
better and was luckier than me (anybody might have found such a man
easily I am sure); and I quarrelled with you for having aged a little
in the rough years you have lightened for me.&nbsp; Can you believe
it, my little woman?&nbsp; I hardly can myself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mrs. Tetterby, in a whirlwind of laughing and crying, caught his face
within her hands, and held it there.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh, Dolf!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am so happy that you
thought so; I am so grateful that you thought so!&nbsp; For I thought
that you were common-looking, Dolf; and so you are, my dear, and may
you be the commonest of all sights in my eyes, till you close them with
your own good hands.&nbsp; I thought that you were small; and so you
are, and I&rsquo;ll make much of you because you are, and more of you
because I love my husband.&nbsp; I thought that you began to stoop;
and so you do, and you shall lean on me, and I&rsquo;ll do all I can
to keep you up.&nbsp; I thought there was no air about you; but there
is, and it&rsquo;s the air of home, and that&rsquo;s the purest and
the best there is, and God bless home once more, and all belonging to
it, Dolf!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hurrah!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s Mrs. William!&rdquo; cried Johnny.<br>
<br>
So she was, and all the children with her; and so she came in, they
kissed her, and kissed one another, and kissed the baby, and kissed
their father and mother, and then ran back and flocked and danced about
her, trooping on with her in triumph.<br>
<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby were not a bit behind-hand in the warmth of their
reception.&nbsp; They were as much attracted to her as the children
were; they ran towards her, kissed her hands, pressed round her, could
not receive her ardently or enthusiastically enough.&nbsp; She came
among them like the spirit of all goodness, affection, gentle consideration,
love, and domesticity.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What! are <i>you</i> all so glad to see me, too, this bright
Christmas morning?&rdquo; said Milly, clapping her hands in a pleasant
wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear, how delightful this is!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
More shouting from the children, more kissing, more trooping round her,
more happiness, more love, more joy, more honour, on all sides, than
she could bear.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;what delicious tears you make
me shed.&nbsp; How can I ever have deserved this!&nbsp; What have I
done to be so loved?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who can help it!&rdquo; cried Mr. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who can help it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Tetterby.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Who can help it!&rdquo; echoed the children, in a joyful chorus.&nbsp;
And they danced and trooped about her again, and clung to her, and laid
their rosy faces against her dress, and kissed and fondled it, and could
not fondle it, or her, enough.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I never was so moved,&rdquo; said Milly, drying her eyes, &ldquo;as
I have been this morning.&nbsp; I must tell you, as soon as I can speak.
- Mr. Redlaw came to me at sunrise, and with a tenderness in his manner,
more as if I had been his darling daughter than myself, implored me
to go with him to where William&rsquo;s brother George is lying ill.&nbsp;
We went together, and all the way along he was so kind, and so subdued,
and seemed to put such trust and hope in me, that I could not help trying
with pleasure.&nbsp; When we got to the house, we met a woman at the
door (somebody had bruised and hurt her, I am afraid), who caught me
by the hand, and blessed me as I passed.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She was right!&rdquo; said Mr. Tetterby.&nbsp; Mrs. Tetterby
said she was right.&nbsp; All the children cried out that she was right.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah, but there&rsquo;s more than that,&rdquo; said Milly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When we got up stairs, into the room, the sick man who had lain
for hours in a state from which no effort could rouse him, rose up in
his bed, and, bursting into tears, stretched out his arms to me, and
said that he had led a mis-spent life, but that he was truly repentant
now, in his sorrow for the past, which was all as plain to him as a
great prospect, from which a dense black cloud had cleared away, and
that he entreated me to ask his poor old father for his pardon and his
blessing, and to say a prayer beside his bed.&nbsp; And when I did so,
Mr. Redlaw joined in it so fervently, and then so thanked and thanked
me, and thanked Heaven, that my heart quite overflowed, and I could
have done nothing but sob and cry, if the sick man had not begged me
to sit down by him, - which made me quiet of course.&nbsp; As I sat
there, he held my hand in his until he sank in a doze; and even then,
when I withdrew my hand to leave him to come here (which Mr. Redlaw
was very earnest indeed in wishing me to do), his hand felt for mine,
so that some one else was obliged to take my place and make believe
to give him my hand back.&nbsp; Oh dear, oh dear,&rdquo; said Milly,
sobbing.&nbsp; &ldquo;How thankful and how happy I should feel, and
do feel, for all this!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
While she was speaking, Redlaw had come in, and, after pausing for a
moment to observe the group of which she was the centre, had silently
ascended the stairs.&nbsp; Upon those stairs he now appeared again;
remaining there, while the young student passed him, and came running
down.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Kind nurse, gentlest, best of creatures,&rdquo; he said, falling
on his knee to her, and catching at her hand, &ldquo;forgive my cruel
ingratitude!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear!&rdquo; cried Milly innocently, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
another of them!&nbsp; Oh dear, here&rsquo;s somebody else who likes
me.&nbsp; What shall I ever do!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The guileless, simple way in which she said it, and in which she put
her hands before her eyes and wept for very happiness, was as touching
as it was delightful.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I was not myself,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what it was - it was some consequence of my disorder perhaps -
I was mad.&nbsp; But I am so no longer.&nbsp; Almost as I speak, I am
restored.&nbsp; I heard the children crying out your name, and the shade
passed from me at the very sound of it.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t weep!&nbsp;
Dear Milly, if you could read my heart, and only knew with what affection
and what grateful homage it is glowing, you would not let me see you
weep.&nbsp; It is such deep reproach.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not indeed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s joy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wonder
that you should think it necessary to ask me to forgive so little, and
yet it&rsquo;s pleasure that you do.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And will you come again? and will you finish the little curtain?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Milly, drying her eyes, and shaking her head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t care for my needlework now.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it forgiving me, to say that?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She beckoned him aside, and whispered in his ear.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There is news from your home, Mr. Edmund.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;News?&nbsp; How?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Either your not writing when you were very ill, or the change
in your handwriting when you began to be better, created some suspicion
of the truth; however that is - but you&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll not
be the worse for any news, if it&rsquo;s not bad news?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s some one come!&rdquo; said Milly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My mother?&rdquo; asked the student, glancing round involuntarily
towards Redlaw, who had come down from the stairs.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; No,&rdquo; said Milly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It can be no one else.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;are you sure?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It is not -&rdquo;&nbsp; Before he could say more, she put her
hand upon his mouth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes it is!&rdquo; said Milly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The young lady (she
is very like the miniature, Mr. Edmund, but she is prettier) was too
unhappy to rest without satisfying her doubts, and came up, last night,
with a little servant-maid.&nbsp; As you always dated your letters from
the college, she came there; and before I saw Mr. Redlaw this morning,
I saw her.&nbsp; <i>She</i> likes me too!&rdquo; said Milly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
dear, that&rsquo;s another!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This morning!&nbsp; Where is she now?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, she is now,&rdquo; said Milly, advancing her lips to his
ear, &ldquo;in my little parlour in the Lodge, and waiting to see you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He pressed her hand, and was darting off, but she detained him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Redlaw is much altered, and has told me this morning that
his memory is impaired.&nbsp; Be very considerate to him, Mr. Edmund;
he needs that from us all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The young man assured her, by a look, that her caution was not ill-bestowed;
and as he passed the Chemist on his way out, bent respectfully and with
an obvious interest before him.<br>
<br>
Redlaw returned the salutation courteously and even humbly, and looked
after him as he passed on.&nbsp; He dropped his head upon his hand too,
as trying to reawaken something he had lost.&nbsp; But it was gone.<br>
<br>
The abiding change that had come upon him since the influence of the
music, and the Phantom&rsquo;s reappearance, was, that now he truly
felt how much he had lost, and could compassionate his own condition,
and contrast it, clearly, with the natural state of those who were around
him.&nbsp; In this, an interest in those who were around him was revived,
and a meek, submissive sense of his calamity was bred, resembling that
which sometimes obtains in age, when its mental powers are weakened,
without insensibility or sullenness being added to the list of its infirmities.<br>
<br>
He was conscious that, as he redeemed, through Milly, more and more
of the evil he had done, and as he was more and more with her, this
change ripened itself within him.&nbsp; Therefore, and because of the
attachment she inspired him with (but without other hope), he felt that
he was quite dependent on her, and that she was his staff in his affliction.<br>
<br>
So, when she asked him whether they should go home now, to where the
old man and her husband were, and he readily replied &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
- being anxious in that regard - he put his arm through hers, and walked
beside her; not as if he were the wise and learned man to whom the wonders
of Nature were an open book, and hers were the uninstructed mind, but
as if their two positions were reversed, and he knew nothing, and she
all.<br>
<br>
He saw the children throng about her, and caress her, as he and she
went away together thus, out of the house; he heard the ringing of their
laughter, and their merry voices; he saw their bright faces, clustering
around him like flowers; he witnessed the renewed contentment and affection
of their parents; he breathed the simple air of their poor home, restored
to its tranquillity; he thought of the unwholesome blight he had shed
upon it, and might, but for her, have been diffusing then; and perhaps
it is no wonder that he walked submissively beside her, and drew her
gentle bosom nearer to his own.<br>
<br>
When they arrived at the Lodge, the old man was sitting in his chair
in the chimney-corner, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and his son
was leaning against the opposite side of the fire-place, looking at
him.&nbsp; As she came in at the door, both started, and turned round
towards her, and a radiant change came upon their faces.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear, dear, dear, they are all pleased to see me like the
rest!&rdquo; cried Milly, clapping her hands in an ecstasy, and stopping
short.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here are two more!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Pleased to see her!&nbsp; Pleasure was no word for it.&nbsp; She ran
into her husband&rsquo;s arms, thrown wide open to receive her, and
he would have been glad to have her there, with her head lying on his
shoulder, through the short winter&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; But the old man
couldn&rsquo;t spare her.&nbsp; He had arms for her too, and he locked
her in them.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, where has my quiet Mouse been all this time?&rdquo; said
the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has been a long while away.&nbsp; I find
that it&rsquo;s impossible for me to get on without Mouse.&nbsp; I -
where&rsquo;s my son William? - I fancy I have been dreaming, William.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say myself, father,&rdquo; returned his son.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have been in an ugly sort of dream, I think. - How are you,
father?&nbsp; Are you pretty well?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Strong and brave, my boy,&rdquo; returned the old man.<br>
<br>
It was quite a sight to see Mr. William shaking hands with his father,
and patting him on the back, and rubbing him gently down with his hand,
as if he could not possibly do enough to show an interest in him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What a wonderful man you are, father! - How are you, father?&nbsp;
Are you really pretty hearty, though?&rdquo; said William, shaking hands
with him again, and patting him again, and rubbing him gently down again.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I never was fresher or stouter in my life, my boy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What a wonderful man you are, father!&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
exactly where it is,&rdquo; said Mr. William, with enthusiasm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I think of all that my father&rsquo;s gone through, and
all the chances and changes, and sorrows and troubles, that have happened
to him in the course of his long life, and under which his head has
grown grey, and years upon years have gathered on it, I feel as if we
couldn&rsquo;t do enough to honour the old gentleman, and make his old
age easy. - How are you, father?&nbsp; Are you really pretty well, though?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. William might never have left off repeating this inquiry, and shaking
hands with him again, and patting him again, and rubbing him down again,
if the old man had not espied the Chemist, whom until now he had not
seen.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I ask your pardon, Mr. Redlaw,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;but
didn&rsquo;t know you were here, sir, or should have made less free.&nbsp;
It reminds me, Mr. Redlaw, seeing you here on a Christmas morning, of
the time when you was a student yourself, and worked so hard that you
were backwards and forwards in our Library even at Christmas time.&nbsp;
Ha! ha!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m old enough to remember that; and I remember
it right well, I do, though I am eight-seven.&nbsp; It was after you
left here that my poor wife died.&nbsp; You remember my poor wife, Mr.
Redlaw?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist answered yes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was a dear creetur.
- I recollect you come here one Christmas morning with a young lady
- I ask your pardon, Mr. Redlaw, but I think it was a sister you was
very much attached to?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist looked at him, and shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had a
sister,&rdquo; he said vacantly.&nbsp; He knew no more.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;One Christmas morning,&rdquo; pursued the old man, &ldquo;that
you come here with her - and it began to snow, and my wife invited the
lady to walk in, and sit by the fire that is always a burning on Christmas
Day in what used to be, before our ten poor gentlemen commuted, our
great Dinner Hall.&nbsp; I was there; and I recollect, as I was stirring
up the blaze for the young lady to warm her pretty feet by, she read
the scroll out loud, that is underneath that pictur, &lsquo;Lord, keep
my memory green!&rsquo;&nbsp; She and my poor wife fell a talking about
it; and it&rsquo;s a strange thing to think of, now, that they both
said (both being so unlike to die) that it was a good prayer, and that
it was one they would put up very earnestly, if they were called away
young, with reference to those who were dearest to them.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
brother,&rsquo; says the young lady - &lsquo;My husband,&rsquo; says
my poor wife. - &lsquo;Lord, keep his memory of me, green, and do not
let me be forgotten!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Tears more painful, and more bitter than he had ever shed in all his
life, coursed down Redlaw&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Philip, fully occupied
in recalling his story, had not observed him until now, nor Milly&rsquo;s
anxiety that he should not proceed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Philip!&rdquo; said Redlaw, laying his hand upon his arm, &ldquo;I
am a stricken man, on whom the hand of Providence has fallen heavily,
although deservedly.&nbsp; You speak to me, my friend, of what I cannot
follow; my memory is gone.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Merciful power!&rdquo; cried the old man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have lost my memory of sorrow, wrong, and trouble,&rdquo; said
the Chemist, &ldquo;and with that I have lost all man would remember!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
To see old Philip&rsquo;s pity for him, to see him wheel his own great
chair for him to rest in, and look down upon him with a solemn sense
of his bereavement, was to know, in some degree, how precious to old
age such recollections are.<br>
<br>
The boy came running in, and ran to Milly.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the other room.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t want <i>him</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What man does he mean?&rdquo; asked Mr. William.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Milly.<br>
<br>
Obedient to a sign from her, he and his old father softly withdrew.&nbsp;
As they went out, unnoticed, Redlaw beckoned to the boy to come to him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I like the woman best,&rdquo; he answered, holding to her skirts.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Redlaw, with a faint smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t fear to come to me.&nbsp; I am gentler
than I was.&nbsp; Of all the world, to you, poor child!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The boy still held back at first, but yielding little by little to her
urging, he consented to approach, and even to sit down at his feet.&nbsp;
As Redlaw laid his hand upon the shoulder of the child, looking on him
with compassion and a fellow-feeling, he put out his other hand to Milly.&nbsp;
She stooped down on that side of him, so that she could look into his
face, and after silence, said:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Mr. Redlaw, may I speak to you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, fixing his eyes upon her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
voice and music are the same to me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;May I ask you something?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What you will.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you remember what I said, when I knocked at your door last
night?&nbsp; About one who was your friend once, and who stood on the
verge of destruction?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I remember,&rdquo; he said, with some hesitation.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you understand it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He smoothed the boy&rsquo;s hair - looking at her fixedly the while,
and shook his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This person,&rdquo; said Milly, in her clear, soft voice, which
her mild eyes, looking at him, made clearer and softer, &ldquo;I found
soon afterwards.&nbsp; I went back to the house, and, with Heaven&rsquo;s
help, traced him.&nbsp; I was not too soon.&nbsp; A very little and
I should have been too late.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He took his hand from the boy, and laying it on the back of that hand
of hers, whose timid and yet earnest touch addressed him no less appealingly
than her voice and eyes, looked more intently on her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He <i>is</i> the father of Mr. Edmund, the young gentleman we
saw just now.&nbsp; His real name is Longford. - You recollect the name?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I recollect the name.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And the man?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, not the man.&nbsp; Did he ever wrong me?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Then it&rsquo;s hopeless - hopeless.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He shook his head, and softly beat upon the hand he held, as though
mutely asking her commiseration.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I did not go to Mr. Edmund last night,&rdquo; said Milly, - &ldquo;You
will listen to me just the same as if you did remember all?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To every syllable you say.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Both, because I did not know, then, that this really was his
father, and because I was fearful of the effect of such intelligence
upon him, after his illness, if it should be.&nbsp; Since I have known
who this person is, I have not gone either; but that is for another
reason.&nbsp; He has long been separated from his wife and son - has
been a stranger to his home almost from this son&rsquo;s infancy, I
learn from him - and has abandoned and deserted what he should have
held most dear.&nbsp; In all that time he has been falling from the
state of a gentleman, more and more, until - &rdquo; she rose up, hastily,
and going out for a moment, returned, accompanied by the wreck that
Redlaw had beheld last night.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo; asked the Chemist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I should be glad,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;and that
is an unwonted word for me to use, if I could answer no.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist looked at the man, standing in self-abasement and degradation
before him, and would have looked longer, in an ineffectual struggle
for enlightenment, but that Milly resumed her late position by his side,
and attracted his attentive gaze to her own face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;See how low he is sunk, how lost he is!&rdquo; she whispered,
stretching out her arm towards him, without looking from the Chemist&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you could remember all that is connected with
him, do you not think it would move your pity to reflect that one you
ever loved (do not let us mind how long ago, or in what belief that
he has forfeited), should come to this?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I hope it would,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe it
would.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His eyes wandered to the figure standing near the door, but came back
speedily to her, on whom he gazed intently, as if he strove to learn
some lesson from every tone of her voice, and every beam of her eyes.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have no learning, and you have much,&rdquo; said Milly; &ldquo;I
am not used to think, and you are always thinking.&nbsp; May I tell
you why it seems to me a good thing for us, to remember wrong that has
been done us?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That we may forgive it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Pardon me, great Heaven!&rdquo; said Redlaw, lifting up his eyes,
&ldquo;for having thrown away thine own high attribute!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And if,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;if your memory should one day
be restored, as we will hope and pray it may be, would it not be a blessing
to you to recall at once a wrong and its forgiveness?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He looked at the figure by the door, and fastened his attentive eyes
on her again; a ray of clearer light appeared to him to shine into his
mind, from her bright face.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He cannot go to his abandoned home.&nbsp; He does not seek to
go there.&nbsp; He knows that he could only carry shame and trouble
to those he has so cruelly neglected; and that the best reparation he
can make them now, is to avoid them.&nbsp; A very little money carefully
bestowed, would remove him to some distant place, where he might live
and do no wrong, and make such atonement as is left within his power
for the wrong he has done.&nbsp; To the unfortunate lady who is his
wife, and to his son, this would be the best and kindest boon that their
best friend could give them - one too that they need never know of;
and to him, shattered in reputation, mind, and body, it might be salvation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He took her head between her hands, and kissed it, and said: &ldquo;It
shall be done.&nbsp; I trust to you to do it for me, now and secretly;
and to tell him that I would forgive him, if I were so happy as to know
for what.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As she rose, and turned her beaming face towards the fallen man, implying
that her mediation had been successful, he advanced a step, and without
raising his eyes, addressed himself to Redlaw.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You are so generous,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo; - you ever were
- that you will try to banish your rising sense of retribution in the
spectacle that is before you.&nbsp; I do not try to banish it from myself,
Redlaw.&nbsp; If you can, believe me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The Chemist entreated Milly, by a gesture, to come nearer to him; and,
as he listened looked in her face, as if to find in it the clue to what
he heard.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am too decayed a wretch to make professions; I recollect my
own career too well, to array any such before you.&nbsp; But from the
day on which I made my first step downward, in dealing falsely by you,
I have gone down with a certain, steady, doomed progression.&nbsp; That,
I say.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw, keeping her close at his side, turned his face towards the speaker,
and there was sorrow in it.&nbsp; Something like mournful recognition
too.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I might have been another man, my life might have been another
life, if I had avoided that first fatal step.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
that it would have been.&nbsp; I claim nothing for the possibility.&nbsp;
Your sister is at rest, and better than she could have been with me,
if I had continued even what you thought me: even what I once supposed
myself to be.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw made a hasty motion with his hand, as if he would have put that
subject on one side.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I speak,&rdquo; the other went on, &ldquo;like a man taken from
the grave.&nbsp; I should have made my own grave, last night, had it
not been for this blessed hand.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear, he likes me too!&rdquo; sobbed Milly, under her breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I could not have put myself in your way, last night, even for
bread.&nbsp; But, to-day, my recollection of what has been is so strongly
stirred, and is presented to me, I don&rsquo;t know how, so vividly,
that I have dared to come at her suggestion, and to take your bounty,
and to thank you for it, and to beg you, Redlaw, in your dying hour,
to be as merciful to me in your thoughts, as you are in your deeds.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He turned towards the door, and stopped a moment on his way forth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I hope my son may interest you, for his mother&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;
I hope he may deserve to do so.&nbsp; Unless my life should be preserved
a long time, and I should know that I have not misused your aid, I shall
never look upon him more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Going out, he raised his eyes to Redlaw for the first time.&nbsp; Redlaw,
whose steadfast gaze was fixed upon him, dreamily held out his hand.&nbsp;
He returned and touched it - little more - with both his own; and bending
down his head, went slowly out.<br>
<br>
In the few moments that elapsed, while Milly silently took him to the
gate, the Chemist dropped into his chair, and covered his face with
his hands.&nbsp; Seeing him thus, when she came back, accompanied by
her husband and his father (who were both greatly concerned for him),
she avoided disturbing him, or permitting him to be disturbed; and kneeled
down near the chair to put some warm clothing on the boy.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly where it is.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I always
say, father!&rdquo; exclaimed her admiring husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a motherly feeling in Mrs. William&rsquo;s breast that must and will
have went!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp;
My son William&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It happens all for the best, Milly dear, no doubt,&rdquo; said
Mr. William, tenderly, &ldquo;that we have no children of our own; and
yet I sometimes wish you had one to love and cherish.&nbsp; Our little
dead child that you built such hopes upon, and that never breathed the
breath of life - it has made you quiet-like, Milly.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am very happy in the recollection of it, William dear,&rdquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think of it every day.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I was afraid you thought of it a good deal.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say, afraid; it is a comfort to me; it speaks to
me in so many ways.&nbsp; The innocent thing that never lived on earth,
is like an angel to me, William.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You are like an angel to father and me,&rdquo; said Mr. William,
softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When I think of all those hopes I built upon it, and the many
times I sat and pictured to myself the little smiling face upon my bosom
that never lay there, and the sweet eyes turned up to mine that never
opened to the light,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;I can feel a greater
tenderness, I think, for all the disappointed hopes in which there is
no harm.&nbsp; When I see a beautiful child in its fond mother&rsquo;s
arms, I love it all the better, thinking that my child might have been
like that, and might have made my heart as proud and happy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw raised his head, and looked towards her.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;All through life, it seems by me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to
tell me something.&nbsp; For poor neglected children, my little child
pleads as if it were alive, and had a voice I knew, with which to speak
to me.&nbsp; When I hear of youth in suffering or shame, I think that
my child might have come to that, perhaps, and that God took it from
me in His mercy.&nbsp; Even in age and grey hair, such as father&rsquo;s,
it is present: saying that it too might have lived to be old, long and
long after you and I were gone, and to have needed the respect and love
of younger people.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Her quiet voice was quieter than ever, as she took her husband&rsquo;s
arm, and laid her head against it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Children love me so, that sometimes I half fancy - it&rsquo;s
a silly fancy, William - they have some way I don&rsquo;t know of, of
feeling for my little child, and me, and understanding why their love
is precious to me.&nbsp; If I have been quiet since, I have been more
happy, William, in a hundred ways.&nbsp; Not least happy, dear, in this
- that even when my little child was born and dead but a few days, and
I was weak and sorrowful, and could not help grieving a little, the
thought arose, that if I tried to lead a good life, I should meet in
Heaven a bright creature, who would call me, Mother!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Redlaw fell upon his knees, with a loud cry.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;O Thou, he said, &ldquo;who through the teaching of pure love,
hast graciously restored me to the memory which was the memory of Christ
upon the Cross, and of all the good who perished in His cause, receive
my thanks, and bless her!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then, he folded her to his heart; and Milly, sobbing more than ever,
cried, as she laughed, &ldquo;He is come back to himself!&nbsp; He likes
me very much indeed, too!&nbsp; Oh, dear, dear, dear me, here&rsquo;s
another!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then, the student entered, leading by the hand a lovely girl, who was
afraid to come.&nbsp; And Redlaw so changed towards him, seeing in him
and his youthful choice, the softened shadow of that chastening passage
in his own life, to which, as to a shady tree, the dove so long imprisoned
in his solitary ark might fly for rest and company, fell upon his neck,
entreating them to be his children.<br>
<br>
Then, as Christmas is a time in which, of all times in the year, the
memory of every remediable sorrow, wrong, and trouble in the world around
us, should be active with us, not less than our own experiences, for
all good, he laid his hand upon the boy, and, silently calling Him to
witness who laid His hand on children in old time, rebuking, in the
majesty of His prophetic knowledge, those who kept them from Him, vowed
to protect him, teach him, and reclaim him.<br>
<br>
Then, he gave his right hand cheerily to Philip, and said that they
would that day hold a Christmas dinner in what used to be, before the
ten poor gentlemen commuted, their great Dinner Hall; and that they
would bid to it as many of that Swidger family, who, his son had told
him, were so numerous that they might join hands and make a ring round
England, as could be brought together on so short a notice.<br>
<br>
And it was that day done.&nbsp; There were so many Swidgers there, grown
up and children, that an attempt to state them in round numbers might
engender doubts, in the distrustful, of the veracity of this history.&nbsp;
Therefore the attempt shall not be made.&nbsp; But there they were,
by dozens and scores - and there was good news and good hope there,
ready for them, of George, who had been visited again by his father
and brother, and by Milly, and again left in a quiet sleep.&nbsp; There,
present at the dinner, too, were the Tetterbys, including young Adolphus,
who arrived in his prismatic comforter, in good time for the beef.&nbsp;
Johnny and the baby were too late, of course, and came in all on one
side, the one exhausted, the other in a supposed state of double-tooth;
but that was customary, and not alarming.<br>
<br>
It was sad to see the child who had no name or lineage, watching the
other children as they played, not knowing how to talk with them, or
sport with them, and more strange to the ways of childhood than a rough
dog.&nbsp; It was sad, though in a different way, to see what an instinctive
knowledge the youngest children there had of his being different from
all the rest, and how they made timid approaches to him with soft words
and touches, and with little presents, that he might not be unhappy.&nbsp;
But he kept by Milly, and began to love her - that was another, as she
said! - and, as they all liked her dearly, they were glad of that, and
when they saw him peeping at them from behind her chair, they were pleased
that he was so close to it.<br>
<br>
All this, the Chemist, sitting with the student and his bride that was
to be, Philip, and the rest, saw.<br>
<br>
Some people have said since, that he only thought what has been herein
set down; others, that he read it in the fire, one winter night about
the twilight time; others, that the Ghost was but the representation
of his gloomy thoughts, and Milly the embodiment of his better wisdom.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> say nothing.<br>
<br>
- Except this.&nbsp; That as they were assembled in the old Hall, by
no other light than that of a great fire (having dined early), the shadows
once more stole out of their hiding-places, and danced about the room,
showing the children marvellous shapes and faces on the walls, and gradually
changing what was real and familiar there, to what was wild and magical.&nbsp;
But that there was one thing in the Hall, to which the eyes of Redlaw,
and of Milly and her husband, and of the old man, and of the student,
and his bride that was to be, were often turned, which the shadows did
not obscure or change.&nbsp; Deepened in its gravity by the fire-light,
and gazing from the darkness of the panelled wall like life, the sedate
face in the portrait, with the beard and ruff, looked down at them from
under its verdant wreath of holly, as they looked up at it; and, clear
and plain below, as if a voice had uttered them, were the words.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lord keep my Memory green.<br>

Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     eBook or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
